<h3 class="subheading">Designed by Legendary Game Designer Richard Garfield, <i>Star Wars</i> Trading Card Game to Allow Players to Experience Intense Star Wars Battles</h3>
<p align="right" class="byline"><i></i></p>
<p>April 15, 2002 (Renton, Wash.)&#8212; Wizards of the Coast Inc., a subsidiary of Hasbro Inc. (NYSE:HAS), unveiled the newest addition to the company&#8217;s extremely popular lineup of trading card games &#8211; the highly anticipated <i>Star Wars</i> Trading Card Game (TCG). The <i>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</i> TCG, which is the first release of three sets this year, features characters, vehicles, and weapons from the upcoming movie <i>Star Wars</i>: Episode II <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, scheduled for release on May 16, 2002. Subsequent card sets for the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG will draw content from every <i>Star Wars</i> era, including the <i>Star Wars</i> movies and the popular <i>Star Wars</i> expanded universe.</p>
<p>The new game&#8217;s innovative game mechanics enhance the <i>Star Wars</i> experience by allowing players to plan and execute the high-stakes gambits and intense action of a climactic <i>Star Wars</i> battle. The <i>Star Wars</i> TCG gives players the power to choose if they will play on the Light Side or the Dark Side, and which weapons, characters and ships to employ in their battles.</p>
<p>Designed by award-winning game designer Richard Garfield, the TCG is scheduled to be on stores shelves on April 23. Garfield is best known for creating the mechanics behind the first-ever trading card game &#8212; <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, which began a whole new game genre and led to Wizards of the Coast&#8217;s pioneering patent on trading card game mechanics.</p>
<p>The <i>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</i> two-player Trading Card Game (MSRP $6.99) contains everything players need to start a game, including a Light Side and a Dark Side deck, a rulebook, playmat and dice.</p>
<p>Also available are advanced starter decks (MSRP $9.99), which contain either a Dark Side or Light Side 40-card preconstucted deck with a foil card and an advanced rulebook. Players wanting to construct their own decks will be able to purchase randomized 11-card booster packs (MSRP $3.29) with a rare card in every pack and a 5-card booster pack, without a rare card (MSRP $1.49). The new <i>Star Wars</i> Trading Card Game will initially be available in toy and hobby stores in the United States, with plans to distribute in Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>On the heels of the release of the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG, Wizards of the Coast, the pioneers of trading card game organized play, will launch a multi-tiered OP system, which will include instructional leagues, DCI-sanctioned competitive tournaments, and DCI-sanctioned championship events. League programs and DCI-sanctioned tournaments will begin in retail stores around the United States and Canada in June.</p>
