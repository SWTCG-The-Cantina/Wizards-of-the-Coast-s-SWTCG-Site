<h2 class="headline">Wizards of the Coast - Leading Developer of Trading Card Games - Secures Rights to <i>Star Wars</i> Universe</h2>
<h3 class="subheading">Legendary Game Designer Creates New <i>Star Wars</i> Trading Card Game</h3>
<p align="right" class="byline"><i></i></p>
<p>January 1, 2002 (Renton, Wash.) - Leading game developer Wizards of the Coast, a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE:  HAS), announced today that it has been awarded an exclusive multi-year worldwide license for trading card games (TCG) based on the entire <i>Star Wars</i> saga.  This deal represents a long-term partnership between Lucasfilm and Wizards of the Coast that will give fans high-quality <i>Star Wars</i> TCG releases for many years to come.</p>
<p>The game's innovative game mechanic enhances the rich <i>Star Wars</i> experience by allowing players to plan and execute the high-stakes gambits and intense action of a climactic <i>Star Wars</i> battle.  <i>Star Wars</i> TCG releases will draw content from every <i>Star Wars</i> era including the enormously successful <i>Star Wars</i> movies and the wildly popular <i>Star Wars</i> expanded universe.  The first Star Wars TCG release, which includes content from the highly-anticipated <i>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</i> movie, will be available in stores in April 2002.</p>
<p>Trading card game players and <i>Star Wars</i> fans will be interested to learn that world-renowned game designer Richard Garfield created the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG.  Garfield, who originated the trading card game concept when he developed Magic:  The Gathering in 1993, has taken the TCG concept to a new level by developing a single game that will appeal to players of all experience levels. An easy-to-learn starter game is the perfect introduction for novice trading card game players, while a more complex version of the same game will challenge even the most seasoned trading card game players.   Another unique feature of Garfield's game design is the use of dice for conflict resolution. </p>
<p>With the <i>Star Wars</i> trading card game, players get in on the same thrilling action found in the <i>Star Wars</i> movies.  Players start by choosing to be a part of either the light side or the dark side, and then build their forces from a wide array of vehicles, ships, and characters from the <i>Star Wars</i> saga. </p>
<p>"By working with the industry leaders and originators of the trading card game mechanic, we know that the <i>Star Wars</i> trading card game will deliver the quality, excellence and long-term play value that our fans expect," said Howard Roffman, president of Lucas Licensing Ltd.</p>
<p>Wizards of the Coast, the pioneers of trading card game organized play (OP) tournaments and events, will continue its ongoing strategy of encouraging competition and game-play through organized play programs.  On the heels of the release of the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG, Wizards of the Coast will launch a DCI-sanctioned OP system, which will include instructional leagues, competitive tournaments, and championship events.  </p>
<p>"With fierce, energetic battles, the <i>Star Wars</i> universe provides the perfect backdrop for the uniquely dynamic game mechanics of the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG," said Carole Pucik, brand manager for the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG.  "The trading card game will let players choose and implement their own complex strategies for fierce head-to-head battles."</p>
<p>Lucas Licensing Ltd. manages all the domestic and international merchandising activities of the <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Indiana Jones</i> properties.  <i>Star Wars</i> is the most successful film-based merchandising program in history.  The <i>Star Wars</i> licensing program is renowned for its attention to product detail and quality in the fields of publishing, toys, games, collectibles, apparel and other categories.
