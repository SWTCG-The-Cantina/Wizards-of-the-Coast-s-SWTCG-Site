</div><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_damageprevention_picMain_en.jpg"><p>The results are in for our latest poll!<br>A big thank-you to everyone who voted.</p>
<p>Since <i>Attack Of The Clones</i>, the role played by damage prevention Battle cards has waxed and waned as the environment has evolved. Recent sets have seen a resurgence in these Battle cards, and today&#8217;s player has more options than ever before&#8212;but what to choose?</p>
<h3>The Bottom Ranks</h3>
<p><b><i>Star Wars</i></b> TCG decks are carefully recruited, with every component supporting the deck&#8217;s theme and strengthening its overall synergy. Damage prevention earns a place through versatility. To be effective, Battle cards must have few restrictions and wide effects. During the game, your hand must be full of options, not &#8220;if onlys&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, at the bottom of the poll results we find the cards with significant limitations&#8212;together receiving less than 10% of your total votes.</p>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rescue')" cardset="" align="">Rescue</a> is an interesting card, but is simply over-costed at 4 Force for the 2 damage prevention or +3 power it grants. Likewise, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('High[Force[Dodge')" cardset="" align="">High Force Dodge</a> is just too expensive at 5 Force. In today&#8217;s environment, you want a few additional features for your money at that level.</p>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Hero@s[Dodge')" cardset="" align="">Hero's Dodge</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke@s[Warning')" cardset="" align="">Luke's Warning</a> are great cards, but by focusing on the Character arena, they're just too restrictive. That said, they should find a place in theme decks featuring Characters without Deflect or Evade abilities.</p>
<h3>The Contenders!</h3>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Pilot@s[Dodge')" cardset="" align="">Pilot's Dodge</a> has remained a favorite in decks since the game started. It may not reach the Character arena, but with so many Characters featuring inbuilt prevention abilities, it doesn't really need to. At 2 Force to prevent 2 damage, Pilot's Dodge allows you to both save a unit and play either another Battle card or an activated ability in that nervous post-setup first turn.</p>
<p>Offering 3 damage prevention to any unit for 3 Force, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Yoda@s[Intervention')" cardset="" align="">Yoda's Intervention</a> was valued much higher pre-<i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i>. It remains a good card, but if you're going to spend virtually all your Force on a single card or ability during your opening turn, you need it to seriously shake things up&#8212;and this just doesn&#8217;t go far enough.</p>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s costly at 4 Force, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jedi[Knight@s[Survival')" cardset="" align="">Jedi Knight's Survival</a> still sees serious play, as it completely nullifies all damage dealt by a single unit, no matter how big. Being neutral, it can see you through an attack by that Death Star, stacked <i>Falcon</i>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Krayt[Dragon')" cardset="" align="">Krayt Dragon</a>, or <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Yoda[(D)')" cardset="" align="">Yoda (D)</a>.</p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_damageprevention_pic1_en.jpg"><p>It may be new, but <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Discuss[It[in[Committee')" cardset="" align="">Discuss It in Committee</a> is straight in at #4 on our poll. Not only does it grant a reprieve for units already damaged, but if you have faster units than your opponent, you can attack without fear of reprisal; play this card in the damage prevention step of your opponent&#8217;s attack, and prevent all further damage dealt in that arena for the rest of the turn.</p>
<p> Discuss It in Committee is also a great first turn play, allowing you to protect a weak arena, and giving you two turns to complete that <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Gungan[Grand[Army')" cardset="" align="">Gungan Grand Army</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Devastator[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><i>Devastator</i> (A)</a> or <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Vader[(K)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Vader (K)</a>. Expect this card to get even more popular when <i>Return of the Jedi</i> is released, as it protects empowering units along the lines of <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rebel[Control[Officer')" cardset="" align="">Rebel Control Officer</a>.</p>
<h3>Bronze and Silver...</h3>
<p>Grabbing bronze is the card we all love to hate, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Human[Shield')" cardset="" align="">Human Shield</a>. Although it only affects one arena, its unpreventable additional effect and the free attack it grants all your Characters can be a game winner. A first-turn Human Shield enabled by <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Cloud[City[Battleground')" cardset="" align="">Cloud City Battleground</a> is simply awesome and very hard to recover from.</p>
<p>Far more defensive, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Vendetta')" cardset="" align="">Vendetta</a> nonetheless beats Human Shield to second place. At 4 Force, it is viable first turn and equally playable in Dark Side, Light Side or neutral decks. Whilst it doesn&#8217;t deliver damage counters like the Shield, it does enable a single, unpreventable super-strike capable of taking down that annoying <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Mace[Windu[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Mace Windu (A)</a> or stacked Darth Sidious.</p>
<h3>And at Number One&#8230;</h3><img border="0" align="left" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_damageprevention_pic2_en.jpg"><p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Strange[Lodgings')" cardset="" align="">Strange Lodgings</a> has claimed a place in Light Side decks since its release in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, and does not look likely to give it up any time soon.</p>
<p>The versatility of preventing either 1 or 4 damage for the same Force cost is unparalleled in the game. Don&#8217;t be afraid to play it without the enhancement; sometimes all you need is to prevent that single point of damage, leaving the rest of your Force to be used on other Battle cards or activated abilities.</p><br><br><table align="center" border="4" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Strange[Lodgings')" cardset="" align="">Strange Lodgings</a></td>
