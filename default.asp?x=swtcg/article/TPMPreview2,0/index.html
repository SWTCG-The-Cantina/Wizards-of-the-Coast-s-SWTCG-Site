</div><img border="0" src="/swtcg/images/TPM_0090Yin.jpg" align="right"><p>I&#8217;ve been given the privilege of bringing you 5 cards from the upcoming set, <i><a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/expansion/phantommenace">The Phantom Menace</a></i>&#8212;2 Space units, 1 Ground unit, 1 Location&#8212;and 1 Dark Lord of the Sith! Let&#8217;s take a look at these cards, and see how they&#8217;ll interact with existing sets.</p>
<h3>Stolen Tech and Lucky Ships</h3>
<p>First up is a Dark Side Space unit: the Yinchorri Fighter, a 3 build point starfighter. For that 3 build you get 50 speed and 2 power/health, comparable to several TIE Fighters. However, this unit also includes free Retaliate 2 and Critical Hit 1. A good price, at 3 build. This card would fit nicely in any Dark Side deck.</p>
<p>Our second Space unit is Vilmarh Grahrk&#8217;s <i>Inferno</i> (A), a very nice addition from the <i>Star Wars </i> Expanded Universe. This sleek starfighter has 50 speed, 3 power/health, with Critical Hit 1. Not bad, but include its Lucky 2, and the <i>Inferno</i> suddenly gets even more interesting. The ability to reroll 2 attack dice, both yours and your opponent's, is simply awesome. Add a Pilot with Evade/Critical Hit and this machine becomes very hard to kill.</p><img border="0" src="/swtcg/images/TPM_0044Inf.jpg" align="left"><br><p>As a neutral unit, the <i>Inferno</i> has options. Light Side players will want to throw on <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Obi-Wan[Kenobi[(J)')" cardset="" align="">Obi-Wan Kenobi (J)</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Adi[Gallia[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Adi Gallia (A)</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Saesee[Tiin[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Saesee Tiin (A)</a>, or <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke[Skywalker[(E)')" cardset="" align="">Luke Skywalker (E)</a>. I suggest Luke (E). That way, you&#8217;ll use Lucky to its best effect.</p>
<p>Team Luke with <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('R2-D2[(H)')" cardset="" align="">R2-D2 (H)</a>, and you get a unit with 60 speed, 4 power, 3 health, Critical Hit 5, Lucky 2, and &#8220;Pay 2 Force  Evade 2&#8221;. Think about that&#8212;reroll two of your attack dice to get that Crit 5, or reroll two dice to get rid of some of that damage flying your way.</p>
<p>For you Dark Side folk, try adding <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Vader[(D)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Vader (D)</a>. That&#8217;s for the same build as Luke and R2, with stats that are pretty nice as well. Either way, a piloted <i>Inferno</i> hits hard and is in turn hard to kill.</p><br><br><h3>The Corridors of Power</h3><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_TPMPreview2_picMain_en.jpg"><p>Next, let&#8217;s walk the Corridors of Power. This Ground Location states, &#8220;When the build step starts, you may either put a Credit counter on this Location or remove all Credit counters on it. For each Credit counter you remove, you gain 1 extra build point this turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Think of this as your own little build point bank. However, you&#8217;ll need to protect your assets. Any deck packing this card will also need to include <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Search[for[the[Rebels')" cardset="" align="">Search for the Rebels</a>, in order to take care of your opponent&#8217;s Ground Locations. While we&#8217;re at it, throw in <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dark[Cave')" cardset="" align="">Dark Cave</a> as well&#8212;both these cards are very similar; they&#8217;re definitely good fits in any deck designed to thrive on many rounds of play.</p>
<h3>"Sebulba There Is Going to Win, I Think..."</h3><img border="0" align="left" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_TPMPreview2_pic1_en.jpg"><p>A few months ago, we saw <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/feature04082004">Anakin&#8217;s Podracer (A)</a>. Now we have its rival, Sebulba&#8217;s Podracer (A). Similar in stats, Sebulba&#8217;s is 80 speed, 2 power, and 4 health. But its activated ability more than makes up for its 6 build cost:<br><br>&#8220;Tap  Put 3 damage on a unit in the Ground arena and 1 damage on this unit. Play when this unit would attack.&#8221;<br><br>With Sebulba&#8217;s Podracer (A) as neutral, the Dark Side finally gets a unit comparable to the <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rebel[Armored[Freerunner')" cardset="" align="">Rebel Armored Freerunner</a>, while the Light Side gets another direct damage unit. The Freerunner already combos nicely with the untap Battle card <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Power[Dive')" cardset="" align="">Power Dive</a>. Sebulba&#8217;s Podracer (A) not only benefits from Power Dive, but can use both Power Dive and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Clever[Escape')" cardset="" align="">Clever Escape</a>. With a good draw, a player could deal out 12 direct damage before his/her opponent would be able to attack. Needless to say, 12 damage counters can go a long way, especially against a variety of Ground setups. And if you team this unit with some cheap speeders, such as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Snowspeeder[Rogue[Two')" cardset="" align="">Snowspeeder Rogue Two</a> or <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Bespin[Twin-Pod[Cloud[Car')" cardset="" align="">Bespin Twin-Pod Cloud Car</a>, those untap Battle cards won&#8217;t go to waste.</p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_TPMPreview2_pic2_en.jpg"><a name="SidD"></a><h3>A Chilling Specter of Evil</h3>
<p>How about one more card? Darth Sidious (D) officially welcomes back Force Denial. His stats are adequate, but when Sidious (D) is in play, each of your opponent&#8217;s Force-activated abilities cost 2 more Force to play. Wow! That pretty much nukes most Evade abilities, and generally annoys the heck out of your opponent.</p>
<p>If you throw <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Yoda[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Yoda (C)</a> back into your Light Side deck, remember you&#8217;ll now have to use 4 Force to tap-and-zap. So which will it be&#8212;Evade my attack, or zap me? Feeling lucky, you little green punk? This works even better if Sidious can dig up his pet <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Nexu')" cardset="" align="">Nexu</a>s; at which point Light Side will be unable to use activated abilities without needing to have serious Force-gain abilities as well.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s all the previews I have for you today. Happy deck building!</p><br><p><i>Thoughts or comments? Visit the message board thread for this article <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=260864"> here</a>.</i></p>
