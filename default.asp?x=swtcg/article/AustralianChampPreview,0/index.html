<table><tr><td>Welcome to the <i><b>Star Wars</b></i> TCG, Australian style!<br><br>2004 is a huge year for Australian players, as the first <b><i>Star Wars</i></b> TCG Australian National Championship takes place on 14th June.<br><br> Until last year, <b><i>Star Wars</i></b> TCG barely had an active sanctioned tournament scene in Australia. That&#8217;s not to say SW:TCG wasn&#8217;t popular here&#8212;in fact, far from it. Each expansion brought more and more players, until people all over the country were pitting Jedi against Sith, Rebels against Imperials.<br><br> The problem has been just that, however. Players are spread all over a country where getting together means travelling a distance equivalent to several European countries! The lucky ones have gaming stores close by, but for most, the numbers and support were simply not available for sanctioned tournament play. </td>

<p>Last year, that all began to change.</p>
<h3>State of Origin Battle: Queensland vs. New South Wales</h3>
<p>Battalions of Separatist and Republican forces slowly collected in two of our seven Australian states&#8212;first in Queensland, then in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Queenslanders started off as the original masters of the Force. During the <i>Sith Rising</i> and <i>A New Hope</i> eras, such players as Bernard Tang, Brendan Nimwegen, David Werner and Kerry Clarkson quickly established themselves as rulers of the sanctioned galaxy.</p>
<table><tr><td><img border="0" align="center" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_AustralianChampPreview_picMain_en.jpg"><br><i>Dragons dominated early Australian sanctioned play.</i></td>
<td>In recent times, however, New South Wales has toppled these Queenslanders from power. First Emperor Palpa-Tyng (Tyng-yann Yenn) rose to ascendency using <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Krayt[Dragon')" cardset="" align="">Krayt Dragon</a>s amongst his trademark cards. Yoda (Scott Hunstad) then banished the Emperor and snatched back power for the Light Side, using a &#8220;if it doesn&#8217;t stack, I don&#8217;t want to know&#8221; strategy. After establishing what many thought would be an unassailable position, however, the Dark Side cast its shadow over the Force once again&#8212;Yoda was forced to disappear into the Dagobah swamps as Dark Lord Lindsay Heming rose to dominate the Australian scene with Han&#8217;s Promise and Rebel Surrender decks.<br><br> The fallout of this recent turmoil is the prospect of a classic "State of Origin" battle (a fiercely contested Rugby League event for all non-Aussies out there!) between Queensland and New South Wales for the national title. </td>

<h3>Predictions: Players to Watch</h3>
<p>So who are the Jedi Masters and would-be Emperors to be reckoned with at this year&#8217;s Australian Championship, and what decks will they be using?</p>
<p>The Dark Lord (Lindsay Heming) is the bookies&#8217; favourite to take this year&#8217;s title. A master of subtle manipulation, Lindsay is the current Australian No. 1 ranked player, and his trademark decks combine build and Force generation combos along with power-denying tricks for his opponents.</p>
<table><tr><td><img border="0" src="/swtcg/images/darth_mace.jpg"><br><i>Expect to see Mace front up to Vader many times at this year's Australian Championship.</i></td>
<td>Queensland&#8217;s hope lies with Bernard Tang and Brendan Nimwegen, whilst the current New South Wales elite are the Dark Lord&#8217;s own young apprentices: Ryan Dare and Shaun Baker. However, it remains to be seen whether any can stand against Dark Lord Heming himself.<br><br>Will Yoda come out of hiding and contest the galaxy with the Dark Lord? Will Emperor Palpa-Tyng try to reclaim what was once his? Negotiations continue&#8230; What&#8217;s more exciting, however, is the possibility of unknown heroes rising from the many gaming groups scattered throughout the country. If only a handful of these players make it to the event, the Australian Championship could be blown wide open.</td>

<h3>Predictions: Decks to Beat</h3>
<table><tr><td>And what&#8217;s expected to be played?<br><br>No surprises with Dark Side. Kessel Swarm is the current deck of choice in the Australian SW:TCG scene, closely followed by <i>Falcon</i>&#8217;s Needs. (Take a closer look at both these decks in Michael Kelly&#8217;s article: <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/DarkSidePowerWhat">Dark Side Power Decks Part 1</a>.) With the <a href="/default.asp?x=events/starwars/bannedlist">banned and restricted list</a> coming into effect a few days after the Australian Championship, this will probably be the last chance for Australian players to field such decks&#8212;and many will grasp that opportunity like a fallen Jedi reaching for his lightsaber.<br><br> For the Light Side, Chewie-Reanimator will undoubtedly be a deck to reckon with, but by no means the only one fielded. <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i>-fuelled Tuskens, Diplomats, Rebels and stacked-Jedi Beatdown decks will undoubtedly all make their presences felt. When you consider that a Jawa-themed deck took first place in the <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/QualifiersDecks2004New">Newbury, Ohio Qualifier</a>, nothing can be taken for granted!</td>
