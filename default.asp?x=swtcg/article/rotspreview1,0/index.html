<p>The <b><i>Star Wars</i> TCG</b><i> Revenge of the Sith</i> set hits stores in just a few short weeks&#8212;over a month before Episode III hits theaters. So here&#8217;s a treat for everyone who would rather get cut in half and dropped down an endless shaft than read another <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> rulebook article.</p>
<h3>Spoiler Alert</h3>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to spoil your enjoyment of the <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> set (or the movie), you might want to close this window and come look at it again in six weeks. Don&#8217;t say you weren&#8217;t warned.</p>
<p>This is your last chance! If you scroll down past the teasers below, you&#8217;re going to see some cool cards featuring images from Episode III.</p>
<p>Before diving in to check out three exclusive <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> cards, check out these interesting facts about the card set:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>The Dark Side gains an economy-sized unit similar to the Trade Federation Battleship Core. <li></li>The Light Side gets a Capital Space unit with Bombard 4. <li></li>The Dark Side gains another Fleet that can repair itself. <li></li>A new Light Side Space Squad will go great with Big Asteroid, Medium Asteroid, and Small Asteroid. <li></li>Over 25 units&#8212;all Characters save 8&#8212;can stack with versions from previous sets.</ul>
<h3>Droid Missiles</h3><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_rotspreview1_pic1_en.jpg"><p>Both sides gain deadly Space units in <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>. The Dark Side has few Starfighters&#8212;all Droids of course&#8212;but picks up two speedy, weapon-like Droid Space units to make up for that shortcoming. One of those (shown here) is Droid Missiles. Droid Missiles is similar to <i>Jedi Guardians</i>&#8217; <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Kouhun')" cardset="" align="">Kouhun</a>, with added value. The Space Droid costs 1 more build point than the Creature, but you get so much for that 1 point.</p>
<p>Kuhoun&#8217;s 40 speed might as well be 0 when facing Light Side Jedi, especially if they&#8217;re stacked. While it&#8217;s not unheard of, many Light Side Starfighters can&#8217;t beat Droid Missiles&#8217; 50 speed without an added bonus. And when this Droid does catch up to them, most Light Side Starfighters can&#8217;t survive gaining 3 damage counters.</p>
<p>Kohoun&#8217;s 5 damage seems impressive by comparison, but that 5 damage can be prevented (or worse, turned against you with Deflect!). Most impressive of all, Droid Missiles has 5 power. If you only need to score one or two hits and aren&#8217;t too worried about prevention, you can instead just swing away with the unit and hope it works out.</p>
<h3>Bail Organa</h3><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_rotspreview1_picMain_en.jpg"><p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Bail[Organa[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Bail Organa (A)</a> offered the Light Side a cheap Character unit that forced the Dark Side to choose between tapping a unit of his or her choice or losing 3 Force. Bail (A) seems pretty wimpy when compared to <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Orn[Free[Taa[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Orn Free Taa (A)</a>. While Bail Organa (B) (shown here) is no Orn Free Taa, he does have some interesting advantages when compared to the previous version&#8212;and even few versus Orn.</p>
<p>Economically speaking, Bail Organa (B) is more efficient than Orn Free Taa for one turn&#8212;which is probably about how long he&#8217;ll last with only 3 health and without Orn&#8217;s insane damage-prevention ability. His other advantage is that he&#8217;s a Diplomat while Orn is not. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Queen[Jamillia[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Queen Jamillia (A)</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Han[Solo[(G)')" cardset="" align="">Han Solo (G)</a>, and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rapid[Recovery')" cardset="" align="">Rapid Recovery</a> can help keep Bail alive. Lastly, he&#8217;s not the only Bail around&#8212;he can stack. A definite advantage during setup.</p>
<p>Bail Organa (B) is tougher than version (A) and he can tap opposing units with impunity. You pay for those benefits, but they can make the difference between winning and losing. As already mentioned, the two can stack together to give you access to either and cheaply draw an extra card during setup.</p>
<h3>Darth Vader</h3><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_rotspreview1_pic2_en.jpg"><p>How&#8217;s this for a surprise? Darth Vader (R) (shown here) comes sans Armor (appropriately pictured) but with so many other goodies.</p>
<p>Vader&#8217;s 10 build cost and Hidden Cost 5 give you a lot of flexibility when it comes to getting the Dark Lord of the Sith on the table. The highest build cost of any Anakin is 7&#8212;<a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin[Skywalker[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin Skywalker (A)</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin[Skywalker[(H)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin Skywalker (H)</a> are two you&#8217;re probably familiar with. While it&#8217;s not guaranteed, Darth Vader (R) should be able to send any Anakin Skywalker that&#8217;s not fully stacked packing if deployed during battle. (This doesn&#8217;t necessarily include any <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> versions of Anakin Skywalker.)</p>
<p>Vader&#8217;s Evade ability is a bit steeply costed&#8212;about 1 Force more than it would normally be. The fact that damage Vader deals can&#8217;t be prevented is excuse enough. If there&#8217;s anything lacking from this unit, it&#8217;s more speed, health, and power. When compared statwise to <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Vader[(K)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Vader (K)</a>&#8212;another amazing unit&#8212;this Vader is nearly identical. While the former is stronger on offense and defense, the latter is just adequate on both. Darth Vader (R)&#8217;s main strength is going to be his Hidden Cost, his unpreventable damage, and his ability to win the contested unit bid nearly every time.</p>
<p>That should give you enough to chew on until next week! Check back here to get your first glimpse at an Equipment card and see a few other exclusive spoilers.</p><br><p><i>Thoughts or comments?
