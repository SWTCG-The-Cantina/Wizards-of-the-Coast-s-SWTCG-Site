<h3>Errata</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Spinning[Slash')" cardset="" align="">Spinning Slash</a>:</b> The card should read: "Each time that Jedi attacks this turn, when its attack ends, choose a unit in the Character arena it can attack that <b>it</b> hasn't attacked this turn." (The original wording is: "Each time that Jedi attacks this turn, when its attack ends, choose a unit in the Character arena it can attack but hasn't attacked this turn." This wording is changed because <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Spinning[Slash')" cardset="" align="">Spinning Slash</a> as originally worded allows the attacking unit to repeatedly attack each unit that hasn't attacked yet. It guaranteed that the attacking unit got to roll as many dice as it needed to discard the defending unit (unless it was discarded or reduced to 0 power during its attack). It also allowed the attacking unit to do that to each unit that hadn't attacked yet. There was also the potential for an endless loop if the attacker was reduced to 0 power.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rulings</h3>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Hardcell-Class[Transport')" cardset="" align="">Hardcell-Class Transport</a></b></p>
<p>At the end of the Space battle step, discard 1 card.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Does <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Hardcell-Class[Transport')" cardset="" align="">Hardcell-Class Transport</a>'s ability make me discard a card if it's in my build zone?<br><b>A:</b> No. A unit's abilities don't work in the build zone. There are some exceptions to this rule, but none apply in the case of this card.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Recusant-Class[Light[Destroyer')" cardset="" align="">Recusant-Class Light Destroyer</a></b></p>
<p>When you finish building this unit, choose Ground, Space, or Character. You may search your deck for 2 cards of the chosen type, show them to your opponent, and put them into your hand. Then shuffle your deck.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> What happens if, when I finish building this unit, I only find 1 card of the chosen type in my deck?<br><b>A:</b> If you only have 1 card of the chosen type in your deck, you can still use this card's ability to put it into your hand. If you have 2 or more, you must put 2 cards of the chosen type into your hand; you can't choose to put just 1 because the ability doesn't give you the choice of "up to 2 cards."</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Bail[Organa[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Bail Organa (B)</a></b></p>
<p>Pay 2 build points, <img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> Tap one of your opponent's units. Play only during your build step</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Can I tap a unit in my opponent's build zone?<br><b>A:</b> Yes.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Buzz[Droid')" cardset="" align="">Buzz Droid</a></b></p>
<p>You may choose not to untap this unit during your untap step. When the Space battle step starts, if this unit is tapped, put a damage counter on the last unit it attacked.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> If <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Buzz[Droid')" cardset="" align="">Buzz Droid</a> attacks a unit and another unit Intercepts the attack, which unit did it attack last?<br><b>A:</b> Whichever unit the <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Buzz[Droid')" cardset="" align="">Buzz Droid</a> rolled attack dice against last is the last unit it attacked.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Combined[Squadron[Tactics')" cardset="" align="">Combined Squadron Tactics</a></b></p>
<p>Pay 4 Force  Choose three of your Space units with different speeds. Each of those units gets +3 power this turn. Play only if you control three Space units with different speeds.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> If two units have the same printed speed but one has a higher total speed (from bonuses such as Pilots and Battle cards), can they both get the +3 bonus?<br><b>A:</b> Yes. As long as you have three Space units with different speeds when you play <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Combined[Squadron[Tactics')" cardset="" align="">Combined Squadron Tactics</a>, those three units will get +3 power.<br><br><b>Q:</b> If two units were different speeds when this card was played but later in the turn become the same speed, do they lose the +3 power bonus.<br><b>A:</b> No. The Battle card only checks their speeds when you play it.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Commerce[Guild[Starship[(ROTS)')" cardset="" align="">Commerce Guild Starship (ROTS)</a></b></p>
<p>Put 1 damage counter on this unit  Gain 1 build point. Play only during your build step.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> How often can I use this ability to gain 1 build point?<br><b>A:</b> Once per turn.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Coruscant[Shuttle')" cardset="" align="">Coruscant Shuttle</a></b></p>
<p>When you deploy this unit, you may search your deck for a Jedi card, show it to your opponent, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your deck.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> What counts as a Jedi card?<br><b>A:</b> Any card with Jedi on its type line. Cards with Jedi in their title do not count (unless they also have Jedi in their type line).</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Sidious[(F)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Sidious (F)</a></b></p>
<p>Discard one of your units from any arena  Gain any combination of build points or Force equal to half of that unit's build cost (round down). Play only during your build step.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> How often can I use this ability to gain Force and/or build points?<br><b>A:</b> Once per turn.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Sidious[(G)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Sidious (G)</a></b></p>
<p>Each of your opponent's activated abilities that cost 0 or more Force costs 1 additional Force to play.</p>
<p>Pay 4 Force, discard one of your units from any arena  Gain control of one of your opponent's units in the same arena with equal or less build cost until end of battle. Play only during your build step.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> If an ability doesn't require you to pay any Force, does it cost 0 Force?<br><b>A:</b> No. Only abilities with "Pay X Force" in their costs cost 0 or more Force. X can be 0, but abilities without "Pay X Force" in their costs are not affected by this ability.<br><br><b>Q:</b> Can I discard one of my opponent's units that I control?<br><b>A:</b> Yes. While you control one of your opponent's units, it's considered "your" unit while in play.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Vader[(R)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Vader (R)</a></b></p>
<p>Damage from Vader cannot be prevented.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> If Vader uses Deflect to damage a unit, can that damage be prevented?<br><b>A:</b> No. Any damage dealt by Vader cannot be prevented. If an effect somehow caused Vader to damage himself, even that damage couldn't be prevented.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dismiss')" cardset="" align="">Dismiss</a></b></p>
<p>Pay 4 Force, discard a card from your hand  Disrupt a Battle card or activated ability. (That card or ability has no effect.)</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> If <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dismiss')" cardset="" align="">Dismiss</a> disrupts an ability, can that ability be played again?<br><b>A:</b> That depends. If the ability can be played any number of times, then it can be played again. If the ability is limited to once per turn, once per attack, or once per some other duration, then it cannot be played again until the next opportunity to do so arises. For example, if the ability "Pay 1 Force  Evade 1" is disrupted during a chance to prevent damage, it can't be used again until the next chance to prevent damage.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Homing[Missiles[Salvo')" cardset="" align="">Homing Missiles Salvo</a></b></p>
<p>Do 6 dice of damage to any Space unit.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> How many Space units can this card do 6 dice of damage to?<br><b>A: </b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Homing[Missiles[Salvo')" cardset="" align="">Homing Missiles Salvo</a> does 6 dice of damage to one Space unit of your choice. It can choose a Space unit in any arena or build zone, including a Space unit you control.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('It[Just[Might[Work')" cardset="" align="">It Just Might Work</a></b></p>
<p>Choose a Space unit, a Ground unit, and a Character unit you control. At the end of the turn, if each of those units is in the arena it started in, you gain 8 Force.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Can I choose a Pilot on another unit as the Character unit for this card?<br><b>A:</b> No. When you complete this Mission, you must choose a Character unit. Pilots are not units while on another unit, so you can't choose a Pilot on a unit. If you have a Character with the Pilot ability in the Character arena at the start of the turn, choose that Character, move the Character to a unit, and the Character returns to the Character arena before the end of the turn and is still there at the end of the turn, then you can gain 8 Force (assuming your other two units remain also).</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lightsaber[Quick[Draw')" cardset="" align="">Lightsaber Quick Draw</a></b></p>
<p>Choose a Character arena or Ground arena where you have a Jedi. Reveal a unit card from your hand. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lightsaber[Quick[Draw')" cardset="" align="">Lightsaber Quick Draw</a> deals 4 dice of damage to each of your opponent's units in that arena with a speed less than the speed of the unit card you revealed.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> If I have <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Padm%C3%A9[Amidala[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Padmé Amidala (A)</a> in play, do I add +10 speed to the revealed Jedi's speed?<br><b>A:</b> No. Padmé's ability only affects Jedi units in play.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Mace[Windu[(F)')" cardset="" align="">Mace Windu (F)</a></b></p>
<p>Pay 2 Force, reveal the top card of your deck  Mace gets +X power for this attack, where X equals the build cost of the revealed card. If it is a Battle card, you may play it during the current play or pass sequence as if it were in your hand; otherwise, put it in your discard pile.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Do I still have to pay the cost of a Battle card revealed this way if I want to play it?<br><b>A:</b> Yes.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Mas[Amedda[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Mas Amedda (A)</a></b></p>
<p>Put a damage counter on one of your units  Gain 1 build point. Play only during your build step.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> How often can I use this ability to gain 1 build point?<br><b>A:</b> Once per turn.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Nos[Monster')" cardset="" align="">Nos Monster</a></b></p>
<p>This unit gets +30 speed as long as there is an Aquatic Location in play.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Does this unit get +30 speed if there's an Aquatic Location in the Ground or Space arena?<br><b>A:</b> Yes. As long as there's an Aquatic Location in any arena, this card gets +30 speed.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Palpatine@s[Sanctum')" cardset="" align="">Palpatine's Sanctum</a></b></p>
<p>Whenever Vader damages one of your opponent's Jedi and that unit is discarded, put two mastery counters on Palpatine's Sanctum. Vader gets +1 power and +1 health for each mastery counter on Palpatine's Sanctum.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Does Anakin Skywalker cause this card to gain counters and get power and health bonuses from this card?<br><b>A:</b> No. Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader have the same name for uniqueness and stacking purposes only. Other abilities treat them as two different units.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rage[of[Victory')" cardset="" align="">Rage of Victory</a></b></p>
<p>Choose an arena. Whenever one of your opponent's units in that arena is discarded this turn, each of your units in that arena gets an additional +4 power until end of battle.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> If a unit with Hidden Cost deploys to an arena after this card is played choosing that arena, will it get +4 power if an opponent's unit is discarded from that arena this turn?<br><b>A:</b> Yes. The ability affects the arena, not the units in the arena. Each time an opponent's unit is discarded from the chosen arena, all of your units currently in that arena get +4 power. If the Hidden Cost unit was deployed after an opponent's unit was destroyed, it would not get a +4 power, because it wasn't in the arena when that bonus was gained.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Republic[Fighter[Wing')" cardset="" align="">Republic Fighter Wing</a></b></p>
<p>This unit gets +1 power for each other unit you have in the Space arena.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Do Pilots on Space units give this unit +1 power?<br><b>A:</b> No. Pilots on units are not considered units or Characters while on other units.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Sacrifice[the[Expendable')" cardset="" align="">Sacrifice the Expendable</a></b></p>
<p>Discard one of your Ground units. If you do, discard one of your opponent's Ground units with build cost 5 or less.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Can I discard one of my opponent's units that I control?<br><b>A:</b> Yes. While you control one of your opponent's units, it's considered "your" unit while in play. <br><br><b>Q:</b> If a unique Ground unit has a printed cost of 5 and has another version stacked under it, can this card discard that unique unit?<br><b>A:</b> No. A unit's build cost is always it's total build cost -- it's printed build cost plus 1 for each card stacked under it.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Separatist[Fleet')" cardset="" align="">Separatist Fleet</a></b></p>
<p>Remove 2 Trade Federation, Commerce Guild, Techno Union, Banking Clan, or Separatist cards in your discard pile from the game  Remove 1 damage counter from this unit. (You don't need to choose two cards with the same subtype to use this ability.)</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Can I use this ability to remove more than 1 damage counter from this unit each turn.<br><b>A:</b> No. You can only use this ability once per turn.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Stubborn[Personality')" cardset="" align="">Stubborn Personality</a></b></p>
<p>Stacks can't be rearranged this turn. Neither player can stack cards from his or her hand or from the build zone onto unique units this turn.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> Can Battle or Mission cards that add cards to stacks do so after this card's played?<br><b>A:</b> Yes. As long as the new card doesn't come from your hand or your build zone (such as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Yoda@s[Training')" cardset="" align="">Yoda's Training</a>).<br><br><b>Q:</b> Can I use <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Hero@s[Potential')" cardset="" align="">Hero's Potential</a> to put a different card on top of a stack if this Mission has been played this turn?<br><b>A:</b> No.</blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Unity[of[the[Jedi')" cardset="" align="">Unity of the Jedi</a></b></p>
<p>Pay 3 Force  Play only if you have three Jedi with different names in the Character arena. Each of those Jedi gets +2 power and Accuracy 1 this turn. (Add +1 to each of this unit's attack dice.)</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> If I have Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker, and one other Jedi, can I play this card?<br><b>A:</b> Yes. Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader have the same name for uniqueness and stacking purposes only. Other abilities treat them as two different units.<br><br><b>Q:</b> If I play this card and one of those Jedi is discarded, do the other two lose their bonuses?<br><b>A:</b> No. Three Jedi are required only to play the card. Once you choose to play the card, that requirement no longer matters. Even if one of those Jedi is discarded during the chance to disrupt <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Unity[of[the[Jedi')" cardset="" align="">Unity of the Jedi</a>, the other two will still get +2 power and Accuracy 1.</blockquote>

<p>When discarded from play Yoda is, 4 Force gain, and into your hand Yoda put.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q:</b> When <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Yoda[(K)')" cardset="" align="">Yoda (K)</a> returns to your hand due to gaining damage counters equal to his health, can your opponent collect a Bounty on him?<br><b>A:</b> Yes. Yoda still goes to the discard pile when he's discarded from any arena. Then, he returns to your hand.</blockquote>
