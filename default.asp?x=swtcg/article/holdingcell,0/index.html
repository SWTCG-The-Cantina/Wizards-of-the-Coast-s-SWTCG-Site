<p><i>&#8220;But where&#8217;s (insert missing character/ship/creature)?&#8221;</i></p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_holdingcell_pic2_en.gif"><p>Bounty hunters aren&#8217;t the only ones to keep prisoners in carbon freeze. In the spirit of <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i>, here&#8217;s the dark and treacherous tale behind those cards that didn&#8217;t quite make the expansion.</p>
<p>According to Henry Stern, R&amp;D Lead for <i><b>Star Wars</b></i> TCG, expansion sets were originally created with their exact number of cards; if the expansion promised 100 cards, then 100 cards were sent to Lucasfilm for approval. However, this didn&#8217;t leave a whole lot of wiggle room. There&#8217;s huge devotion to the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, obviously, and plenty of esoteric discussions can creep into the process (&#8230;does Power 5 reflect the true danger of IG-88&#8230;?). Since these discussions must be settled before approval can take place, this affects the time needed for other aspects of releasing an expansion: getting the cards on film, getting the film to printing, and so on.</p>
<p>These days, <i><b>Star Wars</b></i> TCG expansions are designed with more cards than the set demands, knowing that some will be sacrificed to the process. For a 105-card expansion, 115 might actually be sent to Lucasfilm, since it&#8217;s wiser to cut more debatable cards rather than postpone an expansion&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>So what happens to these cards? As it turns out, R&amp;D also follows a policy of &#8220;no disintegrations.&#8221; Instead, these cards are placed inside the &#8220;Holding Cell,&#8221; a special part of R&amp;D akin to the interior of <i>Slave 1</i>.</p><br><img border="0" align="left" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_holdingcell_pic1_en.gif"><p>Sadly, some of these imprisoned cards will never make it back to the light of day. (It&#8217;s not likely that you&#8217;ll see Kyle Katarn&#8217;s first ship, the <i>Moldy Crow</i>). Other cards must simply wait patiently for their release&#8212;such being the case with one gluttonous crime boss. We&#8217;ve seen Jabba&#8217;s Death Mark, but what of Jabba himself? While he didn&#8217;t make <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i>, Jabba may yet appear in some future expansion.</p>
<p>Until then, he&#8217;ll take up more than his share of space in the Holding Cell, dreaming fondly of his dancing slave girls&#8230;</p>
