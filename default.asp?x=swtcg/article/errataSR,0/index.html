<h3>Errata</h3> There are currently no errata to any <i>Sith Rising</i> cards. <h3>Rulings</h3>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Aurra[Sing[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Aurra Sing (A)</a></b><br>Treat Aurra as a Dark Jedi.<br> When Aurra damages a Jedi and that Jedi is discarded, untap Aurra. <i>(She can attack again.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li></li>Any card that looks for a Jedi or Dark Jedi will see Aurra Sing as a Jedi, even though she doesn't have the word "Jedi" on her type line. This is true even if her card is in your deck, hand, or discard pile. <li></li>Any time Aurra damages a Jedi, if that damage causes the Jedi to be discarded, you must untap Aurra. (She untaps every time she kills a Jedi.) You don't untap her if she damages a Jedi and that Jedi isn't discarded immediately, but is then discarded later on in the turn.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Careful[Targeting')" cardset="" align="">Careful Targeting</a></b><br>Pay 1 Force  Choose a unit with Shields. Until end of battle, that unit's Shields don't work.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>Completely ignore the unit's Shields ability. <li></li>All Shields abilities on the unit stop working, whether they're printed on it or it gets them some other way.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Clone[Captain')" cardset="" align="">Clone Captain</a></b><br>Put any number of damage counters on one of your other Clones in any arena  Prevent that much damage to this unit.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>You can't split the damage from an attack among more than one of your Clones. You can play this ability only once each time a source would damage Clone Captain. <li></li>You can't prevent damage to those Clones in any other way, either. You're putting damage counters on them, not doing damage to them.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Concentrated[Fire')" cardset="" align="">Concentrated Fire</a></b><br> When the battle phase starts, choose one of your opponent's units in the Space arena. Concentrated Fire does 4 dice of damage to that unit.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>You don't choose the unit until the battle phase starts, so your opponent can't stop you from doing so unless he or she retreats all his or her units from the Space arena. <li></li>If your opponent retreats all his or her units from the Space arena, Concentrated Fire does nothing.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Maul[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Maul (C)</a></b><br>Pay 3 Force  Your opponent can't use Evade to prevent damage from Maul for this attack.<br> Pay 3 Force  Evade 1 <i>(Prevent 1 damage to Maul.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li></li>Your opponent can still use Battle cards and other abilities that prevent damage. Maul's first ability stops your opponent only from playing the Evade keyword ability to prevent any damage from Maul during this attack.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Sidious[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Sidious (B)</a></b><br> Pay 4 Force, discard one of your other Characters from the Character arena  You get a number of build points equal to that Character's total build cost. Play only during your build step.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>For a normal unit, the "total build cost" is just the unit's build cost. For a stacked unit, the "total build cost" is the build cost of the top card of the stack, plus 1 for each card under that card.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Tyranus[(D)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Tyranus (D)</a></b><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0">, Pay 2 Force  Choose one of your opponent's units in the Character arena. Tyranus does 4 damage to that Character. Your opponent can't use Evade to prevent that damage unless that Character is a Jedi Master. Play only when Tyranus would attack.<br>Pay 3 Force  Evade 3 <i>(Prevent up to 3 damage to Tyranus.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li></li>Tyranus's first ability isn't an attack.<li></li>For Tyranus's first ability, you don't roll dice. The ability always does 4 damage to the Character you choose.<li></li>With Tyranus's first ability, your opponent can play Battle cards and other abilities to prevent the damage, even if the Character you choose isn't a Jedi Master.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Fog[of[War')" cardset="" align="">Fog of War</a></b><br>For each unit in the Space, Ground, and Character arenas <i>(yours and your opponent's),</i> roll one of your dice. If you roll 5 or 6 for a unit, tap it.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>You roll one of your dice for each unit, so some units could be tapped and others left untapped.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jedi[Starfighter[Wing')" cardset="" align="">Jedi Starfighter Wing</a></b><br> This unit gets +4 power as long as there are no damage counters on it.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>If this unit gets any damage counters, it loses its power bonus.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jocasta[Nu[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Jocasta Nu (A)</a></b><br> As long as Jocasta is in the Character arena, draw 2 extra cards during your draw step and then put 2 cards from your hand on the bottom of your deck.<br> Pay 1 Force  Evade 2 <i>(Prevent up to 2 damage to Jocasta.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li></li>If Jocasta is in the Character arena when you draw your card in the draw step, you get to draw 3 cards and then put any 2 cards from your hand on the bottom of your deck. <li></li>Jocasta doesn't affect card drawing at any time other than the draw step.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Naboo[Starfighter[Wing')" cardset="" align="">Naboo Starfighter Wing</a></b><br>This unit gets +3 power as long as there are no damage counters on it.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>If this unit gets any damage counters, it loses its power bonus.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Padm%C3%A9[Amidala[(E)')" cardset="" align="">Padmé Amidala (E)</a></b><br> As long as Padmé is in the Character arena, each Light Character costs 1 fewer build counter to deploy.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>If you can deploy a unit for 0 build counters, you don't have to put a build counter on it when you start to build it. If you do this, you must deploy it as soon as you can.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Republic[Drop[Ship')" cardset="" align="">Republic Drop Ship</a></b><br>When you deploy this unit, you get +2 build points this turn.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>If you put the Republic Drop Ship into an arena during setup, you don't get the +2 build points. <li></li>If you partially build the Republic Drop Ship at the end of setup, you get the +2 build points when you deploy it.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Run[the[Gauntlet')" cardset="" align="">Run the Gauntlet</a></b><br>When the battle phase starts, choose one of your opponent's units in the Ground arena. Run the Gauntlet does 6 dice of damage to that unit. Your opponent gains +2 Force.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>Your opponent gets the +2 Force after the damage has been done. So he or she can't use that Force to reroll any of the dice or prevent any of the damage.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Senatorial[Cruiser')" cardset="" align="">Senatorial Cruiser</a></b><br>When you deploy this unit, you may return a Starfighter card from your discard pile to your hand. Shields 1 <i>(Each unit gets -1 power as long as it's attacking this unit.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li></li>If you put the Senatorial Cruiser into an arena during Setup, you don't return a Starfighter card to your hand. <li></li>If you partially build the Senatorial Cruiser at the end of setup, you may return a Starfighter card to your hand when you deploy it.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Sith[Infiltrator[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Sith Infiltrator (A)</a></b><br> When Sith Infiltrator is discarded from the Space arena, you may pay 2 Force. If you do, return it from your discard pile to your hand.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>You have to pay the 2 Force as soon as the Sith Infiltrator is discarded from the Space arena. You can't wait and pay it later in the turn or during a later turn.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Suppressing[Fire')" cardset="" align="">Suppressing Fire</a></b><br> Pay 2 Force  One of your units using Bombard to attack a Ground unit gets +4 power for this attack.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>If you choose to use a Bombard ability of one of your units, and that unit is still attacking a Ground unit, then you can play Suppressing Fire to give it +4 power.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Twilight[of[the[Republic')" cardset="" align="">Twilight of the Republic</a></b><br> After you complete Twilight of the Republic, your build step ends and the Light Side build step starts. After the Light Side build step, you get another build step using your remaining build points.<br> Also, the Light Side retreat step happens before the Dark Side retreat step this turn.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>Twilight of the Republic swaps the order of the build and retreat steps this turn, forcing the Light Side player to build, deploy, and retreat before the Dark Side player does. <li></li>You don't get any extra build points during your second build step. You just get however many build points you had left when you completed Twilight of the Republic.</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Yoda[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Yoda (C)</a></b><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0">, 2 Force pay  An opponent's unit you choose. In the Character arena it must be. To that Character 4 damage Yoda does. To prevent that damage your opponent Evade cannot use, unless that Character a Jedi Master or Sith Master is. Only when Yoda would attack play.<br> 2 Force pay  Evade 3 <i>(Up to 3 damage to Yoda prevent.)</i></p>

The ability always does 4 damage to the Character you choose. <li></li>With Yoda's first ability, your opponent can play Battle cards and other abilities to prevent the damage, even if the Character you choose isn't a Jedi Master or Sith Master.</ul>
