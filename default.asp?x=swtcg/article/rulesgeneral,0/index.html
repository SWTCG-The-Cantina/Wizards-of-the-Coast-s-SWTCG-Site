<hr><a name="q1"></a><p><b>Card Names</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>A card's subtypes are on its type line, which is the line below the card's name. English cards have a hyphen between type and subtypes. Non-English cards have a bullet between type and subtypes and bullets between subtypes. <li></li>If a card's text refers to a "Droid" or a "Jedi," it refers only to a card that has the word "Droid" or "Jedi" in its type line. If that word appears only in the card's name, it doesn't apply. For example, text that references Droids doesn't affect Droid Control Ship, because Droid Control Ship's type line is "Space - Trade Federation Capital Ship" (no "Droid").</ul>
<hr><a name="q2"></a><p><b>Contesting Units</b></p>
<p>The rules for contested unique units are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>If both players have a unique unit with the same name in battle at any time during the battle phase, the two units are contested. <li></li>When units are contested, players bid Force to win the contest. The bidding starts with the Dark Side player, who makes his or her first Force bid (of 0 or more). Then the Light Side player makes his or her first Force bid (of 0 or more). After that, bidding continues to alternate between the two players until neither player wants to raise his or her Force bid. Players can't bid more Force than they currently have. <li></li>When the bidding ends, each player adds his or her unit's total build cost and final Force bid. (Total build cost includes +1 for each card stacked under the unit.) The player with the higher total wins the bid. (The Dark Side wins ties.) <li></li>The winner of the contest pays Force equal to his or her final Force bid, and his or her unit stays in battle. The losing player pays no Force, and his or her unit retreats without tapping. <li></li>If there is more than one pair of contested units, the Dark Side player chooses which pair to bid on first.</ul>
<p>Also note:</p>
<ul>
<li></li> If you lose a contest for a unique unit, your unit retreats without tapping. You can put the unit back into its arena in your next build step. The unit will be contested again if your opponent's unit is still there. <li></li>If a unique unit is discarded, you can build and deploy another copy of that unit. (When a unit is discarded, it's not actually "dead" -- just out of the game.) <li></li>Unique unit cards refer to themselves by name. Unit cards that aren't unique use the phrase "this unit." But the card Nexu from the <i>Attack of the Clones</i> set was accidentally printed using its name, "Nexu," rather than "this unit." It is not unique, so its rules text should have used "this unit."</ul>
<hr><a name="q3"></a><p><b>Turn Structure</b></p><a name="q4"></a><p><b>Setup</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>If you run out of units to put into battle during setup, you have to stop. You can't put any more units into battle, but your opponent can still continue up to 30 build points, as usual. <li></li>None of your units' abilities work during setup. They start working at the start of the first turn. <li></li>During setup, you draw a card each time you put a unit card into battle, and when you partially build a unit card at the end of setup. During your build step, you don't draw a card for building or deploying units or building or completing Missions. <li></li>You can't do anything with Mission cards in your hand during setup. You can't even partially build one at the end of setup. You can only put unit cards into battle and partially build one unit card at the end of setup. Space, Ground, and Character cards are unit cards.</ul><a name="q5"></a><p><b>Ready Phase</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>In the ready phase, if it matters who untaps or gains Force first, the Dark Side player goes before the Light Side player. <li></li>"You gain +4 Force" means that you add 4 to your current Force total. It's a one-shot effect, so you add the 4 Force only once, when you play the card or ability</ul><a name="q6"></a><p><b>Command Phase</b></p>
<blockquote><b>Building Units and Mission Cards</b></blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>During your turn, you decide the order when it comes to: (1) resolving bounties you&#8217;ve earned, (2) paying your Upkeep costs, and (3) drawing your card; these are all triggered at the start of the build step.<li></li>You can partially build any number of unit and Mission cards during your build step, as long as you have enough build points to put at least 1 build counter on each of them. (Each time you start to build a unit or Mission card, you must spend at least 1 build point on it.) <li></li>Tapped units in your build zone may still be moved to their appropriate arena during the command phase.<li></li>During the command phase, if you complete a unit, you do not have to move it into the appropriate arena. Similarly, if you fully build (or overbuild) your last unit during setup, you are not forced to move it into the appropriate arena. </ul>
<blockquote><b>Retreating Units</b></blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>You can't retreat tapped units during the retreat step. Only untapped units can retreat, because retreating in the retreat step taps the unit. But, if a card tells you to retreat a unit, it doesn't matter whether that unit's tapped or untapped. Retreating a unit due to a card or ability doesn't tap or untap the unit.</ul><a name="q7"></a><p><b>Battle Phase</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>An attack starts at the moment you choose a defending unit. It ends after all damage prevention and triggered abilities. <li></li>There's a play-or-pass chance before each attack. This is the time to play cards and abilities that increase a unit's speed. <li></li>If your opponent doesn't have any units in an arena, you still go through each of your units in speed order. This lets you to use Bombard, Ion Cannon, and "play only when this unit would attack" abilities. <li></li>If a unit that has already attacked becomes untapped during its battle step, it can attack again. <li></li>If an attack does 2 damage to a unit and you play a card that can prevent 5 damage, the card prevents only the 2 damage. The extra damage prevention is wasted.<li></li>Cards and abilities that do a number of dice of damage aren't attacks. Cards and abilities that affect attacks don't affect a card or ability that does a number of dice of damage.<li>"Until end of battle" means "until the end of this turn's battle phase." Effects that last until end of battle last until the battles in all 3 arenas are over.</li>
</ul><a name="q8"></a><p><b>End of Turn</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>Deal with all abilities that say "when the battle phase ends" at end of turn. You can't play Battle cards at end of turn, but you can still play activated abilities. <li></li>If you run out of cards in your deck, nothing special happens. Just keep playing with what you have.</ul>
<hr><a name="q9"></a><p><b>Abilities</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>You can't use the abilities of partially built cards. You have to deploy a unit before using its abilities. <li></li>Effects are cumulative. If you have two effects that each give a unit +10 speed, that unit gets +20 speed. If you have two effects that each give a unit "Pay 1 Force  Evade 1," that unit gets both abilities (and you can use each one once each time it's damaged).</ul><a name="q10"></a><p><b>Abilities and Battle Cards with Multiple Parts</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>If an ability or Battle card has multiple parts to its instructions, follow them in order. <li></li>If an ability or Battle card includes rolling dice or doing damage, chances for rerolling and preventing damage still happen--in the middle of the instructions on the ability or card. You don't follow all the instructions and then reroll dice and prevent damage. <li></li>Abilities that trigger while another card or ability is taking effect wait until it's finished taking effect. As usual, abilities that allow rerolls or prevent damage are special. They wait only until the next chance to prevent damage or reroll dice.</ul><a name="q11"></a><p><b>Triggered Abilities</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>Some triggered abilities set up effects that happen later. The Overload abilities in the <i>Sith Rising</i> set are an example of this. <li></li>A triggered ability triggers only if all its "when" and "if" conditions are true. <li></li>When a triggered ability triggers, it joins the pool of triggered abilities waiting to take effect. Once it's in the pool, it's certain to take effect, even if one or more of its conditions stop being true. For example, a unit card that says "When the battle phase starts, if this unit is in the Space arena . . ." triggers only if the unit is in the Space arena when the battle phase starts. The ability will still take effect even if an ability that triggered when the battle phase started caused it to be discarded. <li></li>If more than one triggered ability is waiting to take effect, deal with all the Dark Side's abilities, then all the Light Side's abilities. So if one or more of the waiting abilities are from Dark Side units, they all take effect before the Light Side's waiting abilities, in any order chosen by the Dark Side player. If none of the waiting abilities are from Dark Side units, the Light Side player's waiting abilities take effect.</ul><a name="q12"></a><p><b>"Held" Triggered Abilities</b><br> A triggered ability that's "held" is one that's waiting for a time when it can take effect. A triggered ability can't take effect while another card or ability is taking effect unless the triggered ability allows rerolls or prevents damage. </p>
<ul>
<li></li>Triggered abilities that allow rerolls can take effect only during chances to reroll dice. <li></li>Triggered abilities that prevent damage can take effect only during chances to prevent damage. <li></li>No other triggered abilities can take effect during chances to reroll dice or prevent damage. <li></li>While the effects of an ability (even another triggered ability) or Battle card play out, all waiting triggered abilities are "held" until after the effects are complete. <li></li>During a chance to reroll dice or prevent damage, all waiting triggered abilities are "held" until after that chance passes. Any abilities that trigger during the chance join the abilities already waiting and are also "held." <li></li>"Held" triggered abilities simply wait until they're not held anymore (usually after the current chance to play activated abilities and Battle cards) and then take effect normally.</ul>
<p>There are two exceptions to these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Triggered abilities that allow rerolls aren't "held" during a chance to reroll dice (but are always held outside such a chance).</li>
<li>Triggered abilities that prevent damage aren't "held" during a chance to prevent damage (but are always held outside such a chance).</li>
</ul><a name="q13"></a><p><b>Activated Abilities</b><br> An activated ability is any ability on a unit with the arrow symbol (). It doesn't matter what the cost before the arrow symbol is&#8212;if it has an arrow symbol (), it's an activated ability. Battle cards also use the arrow symbol. This doesn't make them activated abilities, because only units (Space, Ground, and Character) can have activated abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>Activated abilities are separate from actual attacks. If a unit uses an ability that is played when it would attack, it is not considered to attack (unless the ability states that it is), and no abilities [triggered] off it attacking come into play. This also means that if you tap and zap, then you can&#8217;t be Rebel Surrendered. However, you must choose what you are doing when you would attack, and can&#8217;t change your mind later. (So if you were going to attack and were then hit you with a bunch of Gifts, you couldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Oh, then I want to use my ability.&#8221;) <li></li>Keep in mind that the rules on activated abilities refer to abilities that increase power and other stats. It is not for abilities they use instead of attacks. This means that Han Enchained does allow the unit to still use abilities like &#8220;tap and zap Yoda&#8221;; it also means that a "tap and zap" would work against a unit that has Han Enchained on it.</ul><a name="q14"></a><p><b>Accuracy</b><br> Accuracy X <i>(Add +X to each of this unit's attack dice.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li></li>Accuracy makes a unit more likely to hit. Bonuses to your attack dice from Accuracy can't create "natural sixes" and increase the chance of doing extra damage with Critical Hit. (A "natural" six is one where one of the dice actually shows a six, before any bonuses or penalties.)</ul><a name="q15"></a><p><b>Armor</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>Armor does not stack.</ul><a name="q16"></a><p><b>Bounty</b></p>
<p><b>Q: </b> When exactly do you earn the bounty?<br></p>
<p><b>A: </b> At the start of the next turn's build step. So if both players earned a bounty last turn, the Dark Side player would get his or her bounty first.</p><a name="q17"></a><p><b>Discard</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>Any time a card is discarded, that card must be discarded from your hand.</ul><a name="q18"></a><p><b>Disrupt</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>You can Disrupt your own Battle cards.</ul><a name="q19"></a><p><b>Intercept</b><br> Intercept <i>(If a unit is attacking one of your units in the same arena as this unit, it now attacks this unit instead.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li></li>You can play a unit's Intercept ability any time one of your other units in the same arena is attacked. If the attacking unit can't attack the unit with Intercept, though, you can't use its Intercept for that attack. You can still pay the Force, but the defending unit won't change.</ul>
<p><b>Q: </b> According to the rules on activated abilities, if you have two units with Intercept and Retaliate, each could use them once per opportunity to play them. Each unit would then have the opportunity to Intercept and Retaliate on one attack. To my knowledge, Intercept does not cause a new attack, it simply shifts the current attack to a different person. Is this right?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> Yes, you can Intercept, use Retaliate, and then Intercept again.</p>
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> Units A and B have Intercept and Retaliate. Unit C is attacking.<br><br> Unit C attacks unit A who Retaliates. Then unit B Intercepts and Retaliates. This gives unit A the opportunity to Intercept and receive the damage, if so desired. Each ability is used once, since there is only one opportunity provided by the one attack. This wouldn&#8217;t create a continuous loop, as there is only one attack to respond to; however, this would still be an effective way to do some extra damage (by spending a lot of Force).</blockquote><a name="TPM_1"></a><p><b>Lucky</b></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>When exactly do you reroll the dice?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Lucky is a keyword with a static effect. When a player (who owns a card in play with the Lucky effect) has a chance to play dice reroll abilities (for attack dice), that player can choose whether to use this static effect after all triggered reroll effects resolve.</p>
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> An <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('AT-AT[Assault[Group')" cardset="" align="">AT-AT Assault Group</a> piloted by <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('General[Maximilian[Veers[(A)')" cardset="" align="">General Maximilian Veers (A)</a> attacks Anakin&#8217;s Podracer (A). After the attack dice are rolled, the Assault Group&#8217;s triggered reroll ability (granted by Veers) triggers and resolves, allowing the Dark Side player to reroll the dice. Then the normal &#8220;play or pass&#8221; chance occurs, when players can play effects that reroll dice. The Dark Side player chooses first. When the Light Side player gets a chance to play or pass, the Light Side player can then use the Lucky ability from Anakin&#8217;s Podracer to reroll a die.<br><br>Other applicable effects or Battle cards (e.g., <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Shoot[Her[or[Something')" cardset="" align="">Shoot Her or Something</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Second[Effort')" cardset="" align="">Second Effort</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Cheat[the[Game')" cardset="" align="">Cheat the Game</a>) can also be played during the dice reroll play or pass sequence, either before or after Lucky is played. Lucky is simply one more dice reroll option that can be played. If both players pass in a row, the dice reroll chance ends, and any unused Lucky effects are lost for that attack.</blockquote>
<p><b>Q: </b>Does the dice reroll ability for <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jar[Jar[Binks[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Jar Jar Binks (A)</a> resolve like the Lucky effect on <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jar[Jar[Binks[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Jar Jar Binks (B)</a></p>
<p><b>A: </b>No. The Jar Jar (A) dice reroll ability is triggered, and it resolves with triggered effects. That triggered effect occurs before the chance to play dice reroll abilities and Battle cards.</p>
<p><b>Q: </b>Suppose I have a power 2 unit with Lucky 2. If I roll one hit and one miss, do I need to reroll both dice? Can I just reroll 1?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>You would have to reroll both dice.</p>
<p><b>Q: </b>What if a Light Side unit with power 3 and Lucky 3 attacks a Dark Side unit with Lucky 2?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Each player has the opportunity to play Lucky effects during the dice reroll play or pass chance. The Dark Side player can use the Lucky 2 effect first, rerolling 2 dice; then the Light Side player can use Lucky 3, rerolling 3 dice.</p>
<p>As an alternative, Dark Side could pass and see what Light Side does. If Light Side plays Lucky 3 and rerolls, then Dark Side could respond with Lucky 2 and reroll two dice. If Light Side passes after Dark Side passes, however, the chance to play reroll effects ends, and neither Lucky effect can be played.</p>
<p><b>Q: </b>Does Lucky stack? For example, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin[Skywalker[(J)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin Skywalker (J)</a> gives a unit he pilots Lucky 2. If he pilots <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin@s[Podracer[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin's Podracer (A)</a>, which already has Lucky 1, does the Podracer now have Lucky 3? And how does this work if the Podracer only has Power 2?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>First of all, Lucky does stack (same as Accuracy).</p>
<p>As you show in your example, this means it's sometimes possible for units to gain a higher Lucky value than their Power. This works the same way as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jar[Jar[Binks[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Jar Jar Binks (B)</a>&#8212;when attacking, if your unit's Lucky is higher than its Power, you would reroll dice equal to its Power. Likewise, when defending and your opponent's unit has Power less than your unit's Lucky, you would reroll dice equal to your opponent's Power.</p><a name="q20"></a><p><b>Overkill</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>The word "health" should be replaced with the words "remaining health."</ul>
<p><b>Q: </b> What happens if I apply Overkill to Hoth Battle Plains? If my Battle Droid Division rolls 4 hits, do I apply 8 damage to one unit, and then assign the remaining damage to another unit? Or do I apply 4 damage to one unit, and then double the remaining damage to another unit?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> The damage is only doubled when it resolves; so, you would only get to apply 4 damage that will then be doubled if it resolves.</p><a name="q21"></a><p><b>Overload</b><br> An "overload" ability lets you give a unit a bonus to its power when it attacks. Each time it attacks and uses this ability, it damages itself at the end of its attack: "When this unit attacks, you may give it +X power for that attack. If you do, when the attack ends, that unit does Y damage to itself."</p>
<ul>
<li></li>The unit doesn't damage itself until the end of the attack. <li></li>You can prevent, evade, and deflect the damage, just like any other damage. <li></li>The power bonus lasts only until the attack ends. <li></li>If the unit attacks again, you can use the ability again. The unit gets the power bonus again, and it damages itself again at the end of that attack.</ul><a name="q22"></a><p><b>Pilots</b><br> {P} [Vehicle] Pilot. The [Vehicle] gets . . .</p>
<ul>
<li></li>You can move your Characters with the Pilot ability onto your units in the Space or Ground arenas, giving those units bonuses to speed, power, or health or giving them extra abilities. <li></li>You can put a Pilot only on a unit that matches the type given after the Pilot symbol {P} and before the word "Pilot." You can put only 1 Pilot on any unit.</ul>
<blockquote><i><b>Example:</b> You can't put a Starfighter Pilot on a Capital Ship or a Speeder; a Starfighter Pilot goes only on a Starfighter.</i></blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>You can't put a Pilot on any unit that has the Droid subtype, though. (There's no room for a Pilot on a Droid ship). <li></li>Each Pilot also gives one or more bonuses or abilities to the unit. These are listed after or below "Pilot." None of the abilities after or below "Pilot" work if the Pilot is in the Character arena.</ul>
<blockquote><i><b>Example:</b> A Starfighter Pilot gives his Starfighter +20 speed and "Pay 1 Force  Evade 2." If the Pilot is in the Character arena, he doesn't get any extra speed, and he can't use that Evade ability.</i></blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>Some cards or abilities can tell you to move either the Pilot or the piloted unit to a different arena or zone. <li></li>If the Pilot is moved, the unit stays where it is (even if the Pilot is discarded). <li></li>If the unit moves, the Pilot moves with it (including when the unit is discarded, returned to your hand, or moved to the build zone). </ul>
<blockquote><b>Pilots During Setup</b></blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>You can't put Pilots on units during setup. You must put them into the Character arena. You can move them onto units during your build step.</ul>
<blockquote><b>Pilots During the Ready Phase</b></blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>If a Pilot on a unit is tapped, the Pilot untaps normally during the ready phase.</ul>
<blockquote><b>Pilots During the Build Step</b></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>During your build step, you can move each of your Pilots once.</li>
<li>If you move a Pilot onto a unit, move the Pilot from the build zone or from the Character arena onto one of your units in the Space or Ground arenas.</li>
<li>If you move a Pilot from one unit to another, just make sure the other unit is the right type for the Pilot. That unit can be in any arena or in the build zone.</li>
<li>If you move a Pilot off of a unit, move it from the unit to the Character arena or build zone.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><b>Pilots During the Retreat Step</b></blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>To retreat a unit with a Pilot on it, you must have both the unit and the Pilot untapped. Tap both the unit and the Pilot. You can also retreat the Pilot without retreating the unit.</ul>
<blockquote><b>Piloting Units</b></blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>As long as a Pilot is on a unit in the Space or Ground arena, the Pilot isn't a unit. The Pilot is just part of the Space or Ground unit. The Pilot is still a Character and still has any subtypes (Bounty Hunter, Jedi, and so on). <li>The Pilot can't be attacked. Only the unit can be attacked.</li>
<li>Any card or ability that says it affects units doesn't affect Pilots on units. Cards and abilities that say "a Pilot," "a Jedi," or "a Character" without using the word "unit" can affect such Pilots.</li>
<li>A Pilot's speed and power don't matter while the Pilot is on a unit.</li>
<li>The health of a Pilot on a unit can matter. If the Pilot is damaged, the Pilot still has damage counters. If the Pilot has more damage counters than health, you still discard the card. This doesn't affect the Space or Ground unit, except that unit loses any abilities or bonuses the Pilot gave it.</li>
<li>Damage on the Pilot doesn't count against the unit's health, and vice versa.</li>
<li>You can use any of the Pilot's normal abilities that still apply. Most of them, like "Pay 1 Force  This unit gets +2 power for this attack" don't apply, because a Pilot on a unit isn't a unit.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><b>Unique Pilots</b></blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>Some Pilots are unique and have more than one version. If a Pilot with a stack is on a unit, the unit doesn't get any extra bonuses from the Pilot, just the normal ones in the Pilot's text box. You can move such a Pilot when you rearrange the stack. You may have to move the Pilot if the card you want to put on top can't be put on the Pilot's current unit.</ul>
<blockquote><i><b>Example:</b> You have Luke Skywalker with the "Starfighter Pilot" ability stacked on top of Luke Skywalker with the "Speeder Pilot" ability. Luke is on a Starfighter. If you wanted to bring Speeder Pilot Luke to the top of the stack, you would have to move him to a Speeder, to the Character arena, or to the build zone.</i></blockquote><a name="q23"></a><p><b>Retaliate</b><br> Retaliate X <i>(If a unit in the same arena as this unit is attacking this unit, this unit does X dice of damage to that unit when the attack ends.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li></li>Retaliate allows your units to strike back at their attackers. Most units with the Retaliate ability require you to pay a Force cost to activate the Retaliate ability. You may use the Retaliate ability even if your unit takes enough damage to destroy it.</ul>
<blockquote><i><b>Example:</b> Darth Vader attacks your <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke[Skywalker[(F)')" cardset="" align="">Luke Skywalker (F)</a>, who has "Pay 1 Force  Retaliate 2." Vader does enough damage to cause Luke to be discarded. You may still play the Retaliate ability to make Luke's dying strike against his attacker.</i></blockquote><a name="q24"></a><p><b>Stun</b><br> Stun X <i>(When this unit damages another unit, that unit gets -X power until end of battle.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li></li>If all the damage is prevented, Stun doesn't kick in. <li></li>Stun works any time the unit damages another unit, not just if the damage is from an attack. <li></li>If a unit attacks another unit that has Stun and Deflect (and the second unit deflects the damage), the unit that the damage is Deflected to loses power because of Stun (because the deflected damage was done by the unit with Stun and Deflect). <li></li>If a unit with Stun attacks another unit that has Deflect, but not Stun (and the second unit deflects the damage), the unit that the damage is Deflected to doesn't lose any power because of Stun (because the deflected damage was done by a unit that doesn't have Stun).</ul><a name="q25"></a><p><b>Upkeep</b></p>
<ul>
<li></li>As a general rule, if you can pay Upkeep, you must pay Upkeep. <li></li>You must still pay the Upkeep costs of a unit even if that unit retreats, becomes part of a stack, or pilots another unit.</ul>
<p><b>Q: </b> Can I try to pay Upkeep before earning the bounty?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> Yes, since these are both triggered abilities that trigger at the start of your build step, you can chose to deal with the Upkeep ability first, and then deal with the bounty.</p>
