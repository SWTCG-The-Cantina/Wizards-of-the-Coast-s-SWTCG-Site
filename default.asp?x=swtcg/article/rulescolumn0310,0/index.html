</div>
<p><i>This spring, SW:TCG will see the release of </i>Revenge of the Sith<i> -- and with it, a new rulebook. Michael Mikaelian continues his coverage of exactly what this rulebook will contain, what's been added, what's been changed.</i></p>
<p>It took the <i>Star Wars</i> Guru discussion group only one week to suggest that the glossary could use a little work. In the end, it was a nip here or a tuck there with the occasional addition or deletion thrown in. Some entries were dropped to make room for a few more new ones, and well over a dozen entries were revised.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s Old</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s no need to fret about omitted glossary entries. Three were so basic and better defined elsewhere that they didn&#8217;t really need to be in the glossary at all: build step, Force step, and turn. The fourth, draw step, doesn&#8217;t exist anymore; its entry was removed.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New</h3>
<p>The <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> rulebook&#8217;s glossary features eight new entries:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>Bounty <li></li>Equipment card <li></li>equip cost <li></li>Force-activated ability <li></li>Hidden Cost <li></li>Lucky <li></li>&#8220;Treat this unit as...&#8221; <li></li>Upkeep</ul><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_rulescolumn0310_pic2_en.jpg"><p>It&#8217;s no surprise that keyword abilities introduced in <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i>, <i>The Phantom Menace</i>, and <i>Return of the Jedi</i> were added to the glossary. What you won&#8217;t find in this version is the same keyword ability defined twice. Removing redundant keyword ability descriptions from section 3 made more sense than dropping them out of the glossary. Each new keyword ability entry includes some new information since the ability&#8217;s introduction.</p>
<p><b>Bounty</b> clarifies that a unit earns a bounty when this ability triggers, not when it resolves at the start of the controller&#8217;s next build phase. This better explains how Bounty and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('No[Good[to[Me[Dead')" cardset="" align="">No Good to Me Dead</a> interact.</p>
<p>The change to <b>Hidden Cost</b> was covered in detail in <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/rulescolumn0217">part five</a>. If you missed it, it equates Hidden Cost&#8217;s &#8220;any time&#8221; with &#8220;during any Play-or-Pass opportunity other than those created by damage or by disrupt.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Lucky</b> was the subject of <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/rulescolumn0207">part three</a>. You can choose to reroll any number of dice up to the unit&#8217;s total Lucky value, but a unit can only use Lucky once per attack.</p>
<p>The final word on <b>Upkeep</b> and the build zone was spoiled in <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/rulescolumn0131">part two</a>. A card&#8217;s Upkeep must be paid at the beginning of its controller&#8217;s first build step each turn&#8212;whether it&#8217;s in an arena or the build zone.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Treat this unit as...&#8221;</b> clears up any doubt about whether or not <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lobot[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Lobot (A)</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lobot[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Lobot (B)</a> can be fished out of the discard pile by <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Chewbacca[(G)')" cardset="" align="">Chewbacca (G)</a>. They can, because &#8220;Treat Lobot as a Droid&#8221; is an exception to the rule that a unit&#8217;s abilities don&#8217;t work when it&#8217;s in the build zone. Serious tournament players know this, but previous rulebooks gave no guidance to uninformed players.</p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_rulescolumn0310_pic1_en.jpg"><p>A <b>Force-activated ability</b> is any ability that includes the payment of Force in its cost. This is synonymous with the text &#8220;activated abilities that cost 0 or more Force&#8221; that appears on <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Sidious[(D)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Sidious (D)</a>.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s Different</h3>
<p>Some glossary entries got a minor facelift and others were nearly or completely torn down and rebuilt from scratch.</p>
<p><b>Activated abilities</b> lose &#8220;You can&#8217;t play an activated ability unless the unit it&#8217;s on is in an arena or the ability prevents damage.&#8221; The &#8220;prevent&#8221; exception still stands (the prevent damage entry hasn&#8217;t changed). How often you can play activated abilities is also cleared up, with &#8220;once each time damage is impending&#8221; added to the list.</p>
<p>The steps of attacking in the <b>attack</b> glossary entry now reflect the changes discussed in <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/rulescolumn0224">part six</a>. It also provides a quick reference for when you would play Battle cards and each of the different abilities that can affect an attack: Retaliate, Lucky, Overkill, Evade, and Deflect.</p>
<p><b>Battle card</b> is the first entry to mention PoP opportunities, and confirms that Battle cards can be played outside the battle phase (see the end of <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/rulescolumn0217">part five</a>). </p>
<p><b>Bombard</b> (as well as <b>Ion Cannon</b>) gains a reminder that using this ability is an attack. This leaves no doubt for newcomers that abilities like Accuracy and Critical Hit apply when using Bombard (or Ion Cannon).</p>
<p><b>Build zone</b> no longer leaves anything to the imagination. Old: &#8220;Activated abilities of units normally don&#8217;t work when they&#8217;re in the build zone.&#8221; New: &#8220;All abilities of units (other than Reserves and Upkeep) turn off if they&#8217;re in the build zone.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chance to play activated abilities and Battle cards</b> is officially synonymous with &#8220;PoP chance&#8221; now. In the <i>Empire Strikes Back</i> rulebook, this entry hadn&#8217;t been updated to add disrupt to the list of special chances. Section 3 describes these special chances in detail and the list no longer appears in the glossary.</p>
<p><b>Critical Hit</b> now says, &#8220;While attacking, this unit does X more damage if you roll at least one natural six.&#8221; Although this was always the case, the reminder text wasn&#8217;t explicit that Critical Hit worked only when attacking.</p>
<p><b>Disrupt</b> was covered in detail in <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/rulescolumn0303">part seven</a>. The updated entry adds activated abilities and Mission cards to the list of legal disrupt targets, clarifies that all costs of playing a disrupted card are lost (not just Force costs), and explains how to handle disrupt abilities with additional effects (such as Disrupting Strike).</p>
<p><b>Evade</b> includes an example to show how a unit can use Evade repeatedly in the same turn (or even during the same attack).</p>
<p><b>Health</b> adds this footnote: &#8220;Remaining health = Health &#8211; damage counters.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Natural</b> (as in &#8220;natural six&#8221;) clarifies that a die result that&#8217;s rerolled is ignored for abilities such as Critical Hit.</p>
<p><b>Overkill</b> trades &#8220;During this unit&#8217;s attack&#8221; for &#8220;When this unit attacks.&#8221; This changes Overkill from a conditional static ability to a triggered ability, for what it&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p><b>Pilot</b> summarizes the big changes featured in <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/rulescolumn0131">part two</a>. (Note: The glossary states that Pilots lose their card type and subtype while piloting. This is incorrect; Pilots only lose their card type, not their subtype.)</p>
<p>Rolling for build points replaces the draw step as the third step of the <b>ready phase</b>.</p>
<p><b>Reserves</b> (and <b>Upkeep</b>) reiterates that only Reserves and Upkeep work in the build zone.</p>
<p><b>Retaliate</b> adopts much of that ability&#8217;s text deleted as a result of removing keyword abilities from section 3.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s All, Folks</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s fitting that the glossary is at the end of the <i>Revenge</i> rulebook, as this is the last article of the rulebook series. That doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m through here, however. I&#8217;ll be back next week.</p>
<p>(Sorry to those of you that searched ahead for the words &#8220;Equipment card&#8221; and &#8220;equip cost.&#8221; You&#8217;re going to have to wait a few more weeks to get the lowdown on what exactly the <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> set&#8217;s new card type does.)</p>
