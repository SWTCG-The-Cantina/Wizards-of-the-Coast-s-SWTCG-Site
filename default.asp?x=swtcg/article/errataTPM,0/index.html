<h3>Rulings</h3>
<p><b> Lucky Mechanic</b></p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>When exactly do you reroll the dice?<br><b>A: </b>Lucky is a keyword with a static effect. When a player (who owns a card in play with the Lucky effect) has a chance to play dice reroll abilities (for attack dice), that player can choose whether to use this static effect after all triggered reroll effects resolve.<br><br><b>Example:</b> An <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('AT-AT[Assault[Group')" cardset="" align="">AT-AT Assault Group</a> piloted by <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('General[Maximilian[Veers[(A)')" cardset="" align="">General Maximilian Veers (A)</a> attacks <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin@s[Podracer[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin's Podracer (A)</a>. After the attack dice are rolled, the Assault Group&#8217;s triggered reroll ability (granted by Veers) triggers and resolves, allowing the Dark Side player to reroll the dice. Then the normal &#8220;play or pass&#8221; chance occurs, when players can play effects that reroll dice. The Dark Side player chooses first. When the Light Side player gets a chance to play or pass, the Light Side player can then use the Lucky ability from Anakin&#8217;s Podracer to reroll a die.<br><br> Other applicable effects or Battle cards (e.g., <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Shoot[Her[or[Something')" cardset="" align="">Shoot Her or Something</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Second[Effort')" cardset="" align="">Second Effort</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Cheat[the[Game')" cardset="" align="">Cheat the Game</a>) can also be played during the dice reroll play or pass sequence, either before or after Lucky is played. Lucky is simply one more dice reroll option that can be played. If both players pass in a row, the dice reroll chance ends, and any unused Lucky effects are lost for that attack.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Does the dice reroll ability for <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jar[Jar[Binks[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Jar Jar Binks (A)</a> resolve like the Lucky effect on <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jar[Jar[Binks[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Jar Jar Binks (B)</a>?<br><b>A: </b> No. The Jar Jar (A) dice reroll ability is triggered, and it resolves with triggered effects. That triggered effect occurs before the chance to play dice reroll abilities and Battle cards.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Suppose I have a power 2 unit with Lucky 2. If I roll one hit and one miss, do I need to reroll both dice? Can I just reroll 1?<br><b>A: </b> You would have to reroll both dice.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What if a Light Side unit with power 3 and Lucky 3 attacks a Dark Side unit with Lucky 2?<br><b>A: </b> Each player has the opportunity to play Lucky effects during the dice reroll play or pass chance. The Dark Side player can use the Lucky 2 effect first, rerolling 2 dice; then the Light Side player can use Lucky 3, rerolling 3 dice.<br><br> As an alternative, Dark Side could pass and see what Light Side does. If Light Side plays Lucky 3 and rerolls, then Dark Side could respond with Lucky 2 and reroll two dice. If Light Side passes after Dark Side passes, however, the chance to play reroll effects ends, and neither Lucky effect can be played.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Aurra[Sing[(C)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Aurra Sing (C)</b></a><br> Whenever Aurra damages a unit and that unit is discarded, put the top card of your deck face down under Aurra. She gets +10 speed, +1 power, and +1 health for each face down card under her.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Do facedown cards also add to the value of Aurra&#8217;s build cost?<br><b>A: </b>No, since they don&#8217;t count as part of the &#8220;stack.&#8221;</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if Aurra winds up on the Light Side with cards stacked underneath her? Do the cards go with her? If the Light Side player controls Aurra, can the Light Side player use that ability and put cards underneath her?<br><b>A: </b>Yes. Face down cards stay with her.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if Aurra is returned to your hand?<br><b>A: </b>The face down cards remain set aside (i.e., out of play) until the game ends.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if a different version of Aurra is rotated to the top? Does she still get the bonuses?<br><b>A: </b>No, the bonus would no longer apply. However, the face down units would stay with her, and they would apply again if Aurra (C) was put back on top.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Do these bonuses work in the build zone?<br><b>A: </b>No.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Boss[Nass[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Boss Nass (A)</b></a><br> Each of your other Gungan units costs 1 less build point to deploy and each gets +1 power.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Does Boss Nass make himself cost less? Does this ability give Boss Nass +1 power?<br><b>A: </b>Since this ability refers to &#8220;other&#8221; Gungan units, Boss Nass doesn&#8217;t cost less and doesn&#8217;t get +1 from this ability.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('C-9979')" cardset="" align=""><b>C-9979</b></a><br> When you deploy this unit, you may search your deck for a Trade Federation MTT card, a Trade Federation AAT card, and a Trade Federation STAP card. Show those cards to your opponent and put them into your hand. Then shuffle your deck.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if you don&#8217;t have all 3 of the units (MTT, AAT, STAP) needed? If I don&#8217;t have any MTT left in my deck, can I still search for an ATT and STAP?<br><b>A: </b>Yes.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Maul[(F)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Darth Maul (F)</b></a><br> Pay 2 Force  Deploy Maul to the Character arena. Play this ability only if this unit has at least 5 build counters on it. At the end of the Character battle step, retreat Maul.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Is this Maul a &#8220;unit&#8221; while he is being built?<br><b>A: </b>No, until he is deployed, he is just a &#8220;card.&#8221; The second sentence should begin with &#8220;Play this ability only if Maul has...&#8221;</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Duel[of[the[Fates')" cardset="" align=""><b>Duel of the Fates</b></a><br>This turn, at the end of each Space battle step, if neither player controls the Space arena, untap all units in the Space arena. There is another Space battle step. Do the same for the Ground and Character arenas.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if there are no units in an arena?<br><b>A: </b>If both players agree that no one can win that arena this turn, skip that arena.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if no damage can be dealt in an arena (e.g., someone played <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Discuss[It[in[Committee')" cardset="" align="">Discuss It in Committee</a> or <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Peace[on[Naboo')" cardset="" align="">Peace on Naboo</a>)?<br><b>A: </b>If it is clear that no one can win that arena this turn, skip that arena.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Do I have to untap units that I choose to remain tapped (such as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Mynock')" cardset="" align="">Mynock</a>s)?<br><b>A: </b>Yes. You have to untap all units, unless an effect says the unit &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; untap (since &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; beats &#8220;can&#8221;). In situations where one tapped unit is holding another unit tapped because the first unit is tapped (e.g., <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Space[Slug[{RaS}')" cardset="" align="">Space Slug {RaS}</a>), both units untap.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Fight[on[All[Fronts')" cardset="" align=""><b>Fight on All Fronts</b></a><br> Play this card only if you have units in all 3 arenas.<br> Pay 3 Force  Choose a unit in each arena. Each of those units gets +2 power and Critical Hit 1 until end of turn.<br> Enhance: Pay 3 more Force  Each of those units gets +4 power and Critical Hit 2 until end of turn instead.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Do Asteroid cards or Spirit cards satisfy this card&#8217;s requirements?<br><b>A: </b>Yes. While those units don&#8217;t count toward controlling the arena, they do count toward the requirements to play this card.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Do I need more than one unit in each arena?<br><b>A: </b>You only need one unit in each arena.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('In[Disguise')" cardset="" align=""><b>In Disguise</b></a><br> Pay 3 Force, Discard one of your Characters from the Character arena  You may put a Character card with build cost equal to or less than the discarded Character from your hand into the Character arena. Put damage counters on the new unit equal to the number of damage counters that were on the discarded unit.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if the new character is unique and I already have that unique character in play?<br><b>A: </b>Play the unit and place damage counters. The new unit is then discarded from play (ESB rulebook, p. 40). The discard is &#8220;due to&#8221; the duplicate discard rule, NOT &#8220;due to&#8221; lethal damage (should lethal damage exist when it&#8217;s discarded). Any events that trigger on placement of damage counters trigger normally. Any events that trigger when the unit is discarded trigger normally, provided all other trigger conditions are met. Static effects based on &#8220;Would be damaged&#8221; and &#8220;Would be damaged and discarded&#8221; are ignored.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jar[Jar[Binks[(B)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Jar Jar Binks (B)</b></a><br> Lucky 3 (Each attack, you may reroll 3 of this unit&#8217;s attack dice or have your opponent reroll 3 attack dice against it.)</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What does &#8220;Lucky 3&#8221; mean when Jar Jar has 2 power? If I miss twice, and reroll his 2 dice, do I get to reroll one of the dice again?<br><b>A: </b>No. His Lucky 3 is there in case his power is boosted somehow (for instance, when he&#8217;s in a stack). Also, his Lucky 3 works on incoming attacks.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jedi[Temple')" cardset="" align=""><b>Jedi Temple</b></a><br> Each Jedi costs 1 less build point to deploy.<br> A Jedi Character can have more than 4 cards in its stack.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Does my opponent gain these benefits as well?<br><b>A: </b>Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if I build up a stack with 5 Jedi units, but then this Location is discarded?<br><b>A: </b>The stack can remain 5 high, but you can no longer add to it. This Location basically turns off the &#8220;a stack can have at most 4 cards in it&#8221; rule. When this Location goes away, there is nothing in the rules that states what should happen to a unit with more than 4 cards in its stack, so those cards remain as is.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Negotiate[the[Peace')" cardset="" align=""><b>Negotiate the Peace</b></a><br> Return to your hand any number of Light units in one arena whose total build cost is 7 or less. Choose any number of your opponent&#8217;s Dark Side units in the same arena. Return those units to your opponent&#8217;s hand if their total build cost is equal to or less than the total build cost of your returned units.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Does the &#8220;total build cost&#8221; apply to each individual unit, or does it apply to the sum of all the units returned to your hand?<br><b>A: </b>The latter. &#8220;Total build cost&#8221; is the sum of all units returned to your hand.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What about stacked units?<br><b>A: </b>The build cost is the cost of the stack, not the cost of individual cards in the stack.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Nute[Gunray[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Nute Gunray (A)</b></a><br> Each of your other Trade Federation units costs 1 less build point to deploy and each gets &#8220;Pay 0 Force  Intercept.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Which Trade Federation units get the &#8220;Pay 0 Force&#8221; ability? Does this affect all of them in play, or just ones that were deployed for 1 less because of Nute?<br><b>A: </b>All of them get both abilities.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Orn[Free[Taa[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Orn Free Taa (A)</b></a><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0">, Pay 1 build point  Choose one of your opponent&#8217;s units. Tap that unit. Play only during your build step.<br> Whenever a unit attacks Orn, prevent all damage that unit would do to Orn this turn unless your opponent taps one of his or her untapped Characters.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Does Orn&#8217;s damage prevention ability work all the time, or only if you activated his tapping ability?<br><b>A: </b>Treat Orn as though there is a line break after &#8220;during your build step.&#8221; His ability works all the time.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Podracing[Course')" cardset="" align=""><b>Podracing Course</b></a><br> At the end of the Ground battle step, if there are more than 2 units in the Ground arena, discard the unit with the lowest speed. If 2 or more units are tied for lowest speed, you choose which unit is discarded.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Does this effect care about the unit&#8217;s base speed, or does it count modifiers like Battle cards that may have been played?<br><b>A: </b>It looks at the unit&#8217;s current speed, and so it includes any &#8220;until end of turn&#8221; modifiers.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Snowtrooper[Elite[Squad')" cardset="" align="">Snowtrooper Elite Squad</a> is the unit with the slowest speed while Vader is in Character arena?<br><b>A: </b>The Elite Squad replacement effect would replace the discard; the Squad would retreat and have all damage removed.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Quinlan[Vos[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Quinlan Vos (A)</b></a><br> At the start of the Character battle step, set aside the top 3 cards of your deck face down. You may look at them at any time and play any Battle card set aside this way as though it&#8217;s in your hand. Put any cards that remain set aside this way on the bottom of your deck at the end of your Character battle step.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Can I use those cards to satisfy any other requirements or pay some other cost?<br><b>A: </b>No. &#8220;As though it were in your hand&#8221; does not mean &#8220;in your hand.&#8221;</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>When I put them on the bottom of my deck, what order do I put them in?<br><b>A: </b>Whatever order you choose.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Sando[Aqua[Monster')" cardset="" align=""><b>Sando Aqua Monster</b></a><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> Choose a unit in the Ground arena with health 4 or less and set it aside. Play only when this unit would attack. When this unit is discarded from the Ground arena, return units set aside in this way to the Ground arena tapped.</p>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens if the Sando is returned to your hand and not discarded, or if it&#8217;s discarded from the build zone instead of the Ground arena?<br><b>A: </b>In those situations, the set aside units would remain set aside for the rest of the game.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What exactly does "set aside" mean?<br><b>A: </b>It means that the unit is removed from the game. Units that are removed from the game can&#8217;t be targeted, tapped to pay costs, etc. If a unique unit is removed from the game, another copy of that unique card can then be played. If the unique unit returns to play, follow the normal unique rules (ESB rulebook, p. 40).</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What happens to a Pilot on a unit that&#8217;s been set aside?<br><b>A: </b>It goes with the unit it&#8217;s piloting. If the unit comes back into play, the Pilot comes back with it.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Q: </b>If Sith Infiltrator (A) is on top of a stack and is discarded, and owner pays the 2 Force to return to hand, does Sith Infiltrator (B) also come back to hand?<br><b>A: </b>No. Unless the card says otherwise (like <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Vader@s[TIE[Fighter[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Vader's TIE Fighter (A)</a>), only the top card comes back.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Can you deploy this unit directly to the Space arena?<br><b>A: </b>No.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Can you use this ability while this card is in your hand?<br><b>A: </b>No. Abilities on a card do not work while it is in your hand (unless the card says otherwise, of course). Also remember that activated abilities only work when the unit is in the arena. This unit must be in the Ground arena to activate the ability.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>What does &#8220;only if no unit has attacked&#8221; mean?<br><b>A: </b>It should read &#8220;only if no unit has attacked this turn.&#8221;</blockquote>

If Nexu and Obi Wan&#8217;s Spirit are both in play, an activated ability that normally costs no Force would cost 1 Force. If Sidious is also in play, this cost would increase to 3 Force, less 1 for Obi Wan&#8217;s Spirit, leaving a net cost of 2 Force.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b>Is this Sidious a Jedi?<br><b>A: </b>Nope, not this one.</blockquote>
