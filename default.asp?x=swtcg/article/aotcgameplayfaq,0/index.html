<p><h3>Errata</h3>
</p>
<p><b><a name="q1"></a>Erratum to Darth Sidious A</b></p>
<p><b>Darth Sidious</b> A <i>(Attack of the Clones)</i><br> The second paragraph should read: "As long as Sidious is in the Character arena, your opponent builds all cards face up." (It was printed incorrectly with "builds all units face up.") The printed wording let players mislead their opponents about the type of cards they were building. The new wording now affects both unit and Mission cards.</p>
<p><b><a name="q2"></a>Errata to Promotional Cards</b></p>
<p>The errata to these 7 cards brings them in line with the wordings of the versions that appear in <b><i>Star Wars</i></b> trading card game (TCG) sets.</p>
<p><b>Anakin Skywalker</b> C (Hasbro action figure card)<br> The type line should read: "Character - Jedi Padawan." (It was printed incorrectly as "Character - Jedi.")</p>
<p><b>Darth Maul</b> B (Hasbro action figure card)<br> The type line should read: "Character - Dark Jedi - Sith Apprentice." (It was printed incorrectly as "Character - Dark Jedi.")</p>
<p><b>Darth Tyranus</b> B (Hasbro action figure card)<br> The type line should read: "Character - Dark Jedi Master." (It was printed incorrectly as "Character - Dark Jedi.")</p>
<p><b>Mace Windu</b> B (Hasbro action figure card)<br> The type line should read: "Character - Jedi Master." (It was printed incorrectly as "Character - Jedi.")</p>
<p><b>Padmé Amidala</b> C (printed as "B") (Hasbro action figure card)<br><ul>
<li></li>The type line should read: "Character - Naboo Diplomat." (It was printed incorrectly as "Character - Diplomat.") <li></li>The version letter should be "C." (It was printed incorrectly as "B.")</ul>
</p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b><a name="q3"></a>General</b></p>
<p><ul>
<li></li>Effects are cumulative. If you have two effects that each give a unit +10 speed, that unit gets +20 speed. If you have two effects that each give a unit "Pay 1 Force {A} Evade 1," that unit gets both abilities (and you can use each one once each time it's damaged). <li></li>If a unique unit is discarded, you can build and deploy another copy of that unit. (When a unit is discarded, it's not actually "dead" -- just out of the game.) <li></li>If you lose a contest for a unique unit, your unit retreats without tapping. You can put the unit back into its arena in your next build step. The unit will be contested again if your opponent's unit is still there. <li></li>A card's subtypes are on its type line, which is the line below the card's name. English cards have a hyphen between type and subtypes. Non-English cards have a bullet between type and subtypes and bullets between subtypes. <li></li>If a card's text refers to a "Droid" or a "Jedi," it refers only to a card that has the word "Droid" or "Jedi" in its type line. If that word appears only in the card's name, it doesn't apply. For example, text that references Droids doesn't affect Droid Control Ship, because Droid Control Ship's type line is "Space - Trade Federation Capital Ship" (no "Droid"). <li></li>If you run out of cards in your deck, nothing special happens. Just keep playing with what you have.</ul>
</p>
<p><b><a name="q4"></a>Setup</b></p>
<p><ul>
<li></li>If you run out of units to put into battle during setup, you have to stop. You can't put any more units into battle, but your opponent can still continue up to 30 build points, as usual. <li></li>None of your units' abilities work during setup. They start working at the start of the first turn. <li></li>During setup, you draw a card each time you put a unit card into battle, and when you partially build a unit card at the end of setup. During your build step, you don't draw a card for building or deploying units or building or completing Missions. <li></li>You can't do anything with Mission cards in your hand during setup. You can't even partially build one at the end of setup. You can only put unit cards into battle and partially build one unit card at the end of setup. Space, Ground, and Character cards are unit cards.</ul>
</p>
<p><b><a name="q5"></a>Ready Phase</b></p>
<p>In the ready phase, if it matters who untaps, gains Force, or draws a card first, the Dark Side player goes before the Light Side player.</p>
<p><b><a name="q6"></a>Command Phase</b></p>
<p><ul>
<li></li>You can partially build any number of unit and Mission cards during your build step, as long as you have enough build points to put at least 1 build counter on each of them. (Each time you start to build a unit or Mission card, you must spend at least 1 build point on it.) <li></li>You can't retreat tapped units during the retreat step. Only untapped units can retreat, because retreating in the retreat step taps the unit. But, if a card tells you to retreat a unit, it doesn't matter whether that unit's tapped or untapped. Retreating a unit due to a card or ability doesn't tap or untap the unit.</ul>
</p>
<p><b><a name="q7"></a>Battle Phase</b></p>
<p><ul>
<li></li>There's a play-or-pass chance before each attack. This is the time to play cards and abilities that increase a unit's speed. <li></li>If your opponent doesn't have any units in an arena, you still go through each of your units in speed order. This lets you to use Bombard, Ion Cannon, and "play only when this unit would attack" abilities. <li></li>If a unit that has already attacked becomes untapped during its battle step, it can attack again. <li></li>If an attack does 2 damage to a unit and you play a card that can prevent 5 damage, the card prevents only the 2 damage. The extra damage prevention is wasted.</ul>
</p>
<p><b><a name="q8"></a>End of Turn</b></p>
<p>Deal with all abilities that say "when the battle phase ends" at end of turn. You can't play Battle cards at end of turn, but you can still play activated abilities.</p>
<p><b><a name="q9"></a>Specific Cards</b></p>
<p><b>Attract Enemy Fire</b><i>(Attack of the Clones)</i><br> If you have a unit that can't be attacked (because of Tyranus's Edict or a similar card), there's no way to attack it at all. If you play Attract Enemy Fire, you can't change the defending unit to a unit that can't be attacked.</p>
<p><b>Clone Officer</b><i>(Attack of the Clones)</i><br> The Clone Officer says "each of your Clones get +1 power." Its subtype includes "Clone," so its ability will give itself +1 power in addition to giving each of your other Clones +1 power.</p>
<p><b>Dark Side's Command</b> and <b>Dark Side's Compulsion</b><i>(Attack of the Clones)</i><br><ul>
<li></li>Playing one of these two cards during an attack doesn't cancel that attack. It just lets you attack with one of your opponent's units. <li></li>If you choose to use the effect, then you get to make all the choices about which of your opponent's units is attacked. Your opponent can't choose not to attack and can't play an ability. If you choose not to use the effect, or if you can't use it because none of your opponent's units can be attacked, the unit attacks normally. In that case, your opponent gets to make all the choices, just like a normal attack.</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Jango Fett</b> C (Hasbro action figure card)<br> There's a typo in this card's rules text. The word "attacking" was printed without the letter "c."</p>
<p><b>Obi-Wan Kenobi</b> B <i>(Attack of the Clones)</i><br> You can use the "Pay 1 Force {A} Prevent 1 damage to Anakin Skywalker" ability even when Obi-Wan has retreated to the build zone.</p>
<p><b>War Will Follow</b><i>(Attack of the Clones)</i><br><ul>
<li></li>You can't ever deploy a partially built card. You can deploy only units that have been retreated. <li></li>This card uses the term "build area," where it should have used "build zone." The two terms mean the same thing, but future cards will always use "build zone," not "build area."</ul>
