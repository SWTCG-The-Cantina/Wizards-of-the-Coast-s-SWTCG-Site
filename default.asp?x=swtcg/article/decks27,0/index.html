<p> I used to have this crazy deck put together that had nothing but cards in it that had something to do with build points. It never won a game, but it was impossible to defeat in under an hour, as I always had something to build each turn. I liked playing it, but soon no one would play me unless I promised not to use it. So I went back to the drawing board and came up with a very effective version with some of the newer cards. This version has a lot more 'beef' to it and wins a good percentage of the time. I'm sure in a few days no one will want to play against this version either. </p>
<p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_decks27_picMain_en.jpg"> One of the best ways the Light Side can gain some quick build is with <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Obi-Wan@s[Task')" cardset="" align="">Obi-Wan's Task</a>. The only downside to the Mission card is that you must tap a Jedi to use it. Obviously you wouldn't want to tap a powerful Jedi and lose the chance to attack with it, so the smaller Jedi are the way to go. One of the best small Jedi is <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Aayla[Secura[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Aayla Secura (A)</a>. She may seem wimpy, but her special ability allows her to take a few hits and not even worry about it. I've seen her end the battle phase with 2 hits enough times to really appreciate her healing ability. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Yoda[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Yoda (B)</a> is a decent mid-sized Jedi who can stay alive a long time. He's not worth deploying in the early game, however, as his excellent activated abilities require a lot of Force. The mainstays of the deck are Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Luke. There are cheap versions of each of them that are still decent fighters. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Obi-Wan[Kenobi[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Obi-Wan Kenobi (B)</a> is the best mid-sized Jedi of the bunch and after he gets damaged, he can hang back in the build zone and help prevent damage to Anakin. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Obi-Wan[Kenobi[(G)')" cardset="" align="">Obi-Wan Kenobi (G)</a>'s Intercept is great in tandem with Aayla or any other damaged Jedi. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin[Skywalker[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin Skywalker (B)</a>'s ability to "remote pilot" a Ground arena unit is fantastic once Character has been cleared of opposition. It's even better when Darth Vader is present. At 5 build, he isn't likely to beat Vader in the contested unit bidding, but you can tap Anakin (B) to boost a Ground unit and let Vader stay in the arena. The boost still happens and Anakin is booted back to the build zone to try again next time. But at least he's safe! <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin[Skywalker[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin Skywalker (C)</a> is a fast-hitting unit that does just fine on his own should it come down to it. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke[Skywalker[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Luke Skywalker (C)</a> is the least expensive Jedi around and chances are great that there'll be another Jedi around to show him the ropes, so he does well in the deck. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke[Skywalker[(F)')" cardset="" align="">Luke Skywalker (F)</a> is the unit of choice against a swarm deck as he has a cheap Evade ability and Retaliate. Probably the best unit to tap for the Task is <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jocasta[Nu[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Jocasta Nu (A)</a>. She fights like a librarian, so you won't miss her attack much. Her ability to sift through cards makes her a great asset for this deck. Finally, for a bit of card draw, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Princess[Leia[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Princess Leia (C)</a> has a very nice reward for her departure&#8230; 3 cards! She also makes great fodder for <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Departure[Time')" cardset="" align="">Departure Time</a>. </p>
<p> The deck needs <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Departure[Time')" cardset="" align="">Departure Time</a>, as there are several very large units in the Ground arena. The main tactic of this deck is to get out a couple of huge Ground units so they can take the Ground arena&#8230; and then help out in Space. Yes, that's right, with Ion Cannons. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Mobile[Assault[Cannon')" cardset="" align="">Mobile Assault Cannon</a> is a monster of a unit and has a decent speed for being so big. Its Ion Cannon 2 is wimpy, but it only takes a few shots to scare away TIE Fighters and the like. For serious Space harassment, the <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Naboo[Spaceport')" cardset="" align="">Naboo Spaceport</a>'s Ion Cannon 4 will have them redoubling their efforts in Ground, which is just fine as this deck can last a long time there. Providing backup are <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Tatooine[Hangar')" cardset="" align="">Tatooine Hangar</a>s and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke@s[Speeder[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Luke's Speeder (A)</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke@s[Speeder[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Luke's Speeder (B)</a>. The Speeders are good for a quick hit on something and are further build manipulation for a deck that specializes in it. </p>
<p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_decks27_pic1_en.jpg"> When your opponent sees some of the Space units this deck runs, he'll be licking his chops. If you saw your opponent deploy a bunch of weak units in an arena to use their special tap abilities, you'd move in there in a flash to take &#8216;em out without fear of reprisal. However, against this deck, the Dark Side is likely to become <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lost[in[the[Asteroids')" cardset="" align="">Lost in the Asteroids</a> and receive a few Ion Cannon hits before it manages to get any good shots in. These utility units are <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Corellian[Corvette')" cardset="" align="">Corellian Corvette</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Corellian[Star[Shuttle')" cardset="" align="">Corellian Star Shuttle</a>. If I draw a <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lost[in[the[Asteroids')" cardset="" align="">Lost in the Asteroids</a> in my opening hand, these are sure builds during setup. But sometimes it's good to wait until you've deployed a couple of Ion Cannon units during setup first. That way the Dark Side is likely to devote more units to the Ground arena than Space. The longer these two units live, the better your odds of winning. When it comes time to actually fight in Space, the unit that gets the job done is the <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('X-wing[Attack[Formation')" cardset="" align="">X-wing Attack Formation</a>. While its Evade ability is great, its speed and Critical Hit 3 make it a severe threat to any Dark Side ship. Also in the offense department is <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Obi-Wan@s[Starfighter[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Obi-Wan's Starfighter (A)</a> with its Critical Hit 2 and annoying habit of healing itself up. </p>
<p> The Critical Hit units in Space and the slow speed of the Ground units leave this deck wanting some speed or hitting power. Heck, you might as well get both with <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Windu@s[Solution')" cardset="" align="">Windu's Solution</a>. The +30 speed is enough to get the Assault Cannon a very early attack, while the +2 power nearly guarantees that the Crit units will get a 6 on one of the dice. Providing protection for the Space and Ground units is <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Pilot@s[Dodge')" cardset="" align="">Pilot's Dodge</a>. The big Ground units are expensive enough that protecting them is essential. To that end, a couple of <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Return[to[Spaceport')" cardset="" align="">Return to Spaceport</a>s are necessary to keep them in fighting shape for the long-term. </p>
<p> Now it's time to look at the heart of the deck: the "build" Missions. I've already mentioned <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Obi-Wan@s[Task')" cardset="" align="">Obi-Wan's Task</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Departure[Time')" cardset="" align="">Departure Time</a>. There's one additional Mission that has occasionally saved the day: <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Contingency[Plan')" cardset="" align="">Contingency Plan</a>. Since the Ground units are so big, it sometimes takes several turns to build them. Sometimes a different arena suddenly is in immediate need of help, so the Plan is a great way to spring a surprise on the Dark Side. Sure you'll have to take counters off of the big Ground unit, but being able to deploy a 5 or 6 cost unit when the build roll is a '1' is often a lifesaver. The other reason for it is to get more use out of <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke@s[Speeder[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Luke's Speeder (A)</a>. It can only add build counters to a Space unit, but once it does, you can Plan them anywhere you wish. </p>
<p> Here's what the deck looks like all put together&#8230; </p>

<p><b> Strategy Advice </b></p>
<p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_decks27_pic2_en.jpg"> After seeing your opening hand, deciding what to mulligan is a bit tricky. If you have a utility Space unit or two, hang onto <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lost[in[the[Asteroids')" cardset="" align="">Lost in the Asteroids</a>. If you have a cheap Jedi, hang onto <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Obi-Wan@s[Task')" cardset="" align="">Obi-Wan's Task</a>. Since the deck's build costs are so high, you can hang onto up to three Battle and/or Mission cards. However, mulligan <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Departure[Time')" cardset="" align="">Departure Time</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Return[to[Spaceport')" cardset="" align="">Return to Spaceport</a> as they aren't needed in the first couple of turns. </p>
<p> A great opening setup (subject to Dark Side plays) would be: <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jocasta[Nu[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Jocasta Nu (A)</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Mobile[Assault[Cannon')" cardset="" align="">Mobile Assault Cannon</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Naboo[Spaceport')" cardset="" align="">Naboo Spaceport</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Corellian[Corvette')" cardset="" align="">Corellian Corvette</a>, and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Corellian[Star[Shuttle')" cardset="" align="">Corellian Star Shuttle</a>. Once you run out of <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lost[in[the[Asteroids')" cardset="" align="">Lost in the Asteroids</a>, the Corvette makes for good <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Departure[Time')" cardset="" align="">Departure Time</a> bait, as it doesn't fight well. That should get you enough build to bring in a X-wing Attack Formation to do the dirty work. </p>
<p> This deck is a lot of fun to play as it can make surprising moves. Most decks don't do so well with low build rolls, while this deck doesn't mind them at all. </p>
