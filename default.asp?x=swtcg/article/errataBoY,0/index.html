<h3>Errata</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Millennium[Falcon[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Millennium Falcon (C)</a></b>: The type line should read: "Space - Independent Transport." (It was printed incorrectly as "Space - Independent Cruiser.")</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rulings</h3>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Blow[This[Thing')" cardset="" align="">Blow This Thing</a></b><br>Pay 8 Force  For this attack, roll only 1 of your dice instead of a number of dice equal to the attacking unit's power. If the attacking unit damages the defending unit, the defending unit is discarded. Play only if one of your units is attacking.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the 1-die attack results in a hit, that damage may still be prevented. If the damage is prevented, Blow This Thing has no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Celebrate[the[Victory')" cardset="" align="">Celebrate the Victory</a></b><br>Draw 5 cards. You can complete Celebrate the Victory only if your opponent has no units in the Space arena and no Space units in his or her build zone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Face-down cards in a build zone aren't units and have no effect on whether or not you can complete Celebrate the Victory.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Chariot[Light[Assault[Vehicle')" cardset="" align="">Chariot Light Assault Vehicle</a></b><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> One of your units in the Ground arena gets Accuracy 1 for this attack <i>(add +1 to each of that unit's attack dice).</i> Play only when that unit is attacking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chariot Light Assault Vehicle gives one of your other units in the Ground arena Accuracy 1. That unit must already be attacking, so it must have higher speed or some other way to attack before Chariot Light Assault Vehicle would attack.</li>
<li>Chariot Light Assault Vehicle can't give itself Accuracy 1, since it would already be tapped when it attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Chewbacca[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Chewbacca (B)</a></b><br>When you draw a card, if Chewbacca is in the Character arena, remove 1 damage counter from one of your Space or Ground units.<br><br> Pay 1 Force  Retaliate 2 <i>(If a unit in the same arena as Chewbacca is attacking him, he does 2 dice of damage to that unit when the attack ends.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Chewbacca's ability to remove damage counters activates whenever you draw a card, whether that is during your draw step or as an effect that happens at some other time.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Countermeasures')" cardset="" align="">Countermeasures</a></b><br>Pay 4 Force  For this attack, when the attacking unit damages the defending unit, it also does that much damage to itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must play Countermeasures before dice are rolled for this attack.</li>
<li>Both units suffer an equal amount of damage after damage prevention. Any damage that is prevented to the defending unit for this attack is also prevented for the attacking unit.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Creature[Attack')" cardset="" align="">Creature Attack</a></b><br>When the battle phase starts, your opponent chooses one of his or her units in the Character arena. Creature Attack does 5 dice of damage to that unit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creature Attack has no effect if your opponent has no units in the Character arena when the battle phase starts.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Vader[(F)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Vader (F)</a></b><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0">, Pay 4 Force  Choose one of your opponent's Characters with health 3 or less in the Character arena. Your opponent discards that Character. Play only when Vader would attack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Darth Vader's ability affects only a Character whose total health is 3 or less. Stacking a unique Character with printed health 3 or less could make its total health 4 or more, so this ability couldn't affect it.</li>
<li>Damage counters on your opponent's Characters don't affect this ability. For example, a Character with 5 health who has 2 or more damage counters remains unaffected by this ability.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Death[Star[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Death Star (C)</a></b><br>Each Starfighter gets Critical Hit 3 as long as it's attacking the Death Star. <img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> Each player discards all of his or her units in the Ground arena. Play only if your opponent has no units in the Space arena and only when the Death Star would attack.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't use this ability if your opponent has any units in the Space arena. Space units in your opponent's build zone have no effect on whether or not you can use the Death Star's ability.</li>
<li>When this ability is activated, all your units and all your opponent's units in the Ground arena (including their Pilots, if any) are discarded. Units in your build zone and your opponent's build zone aren't affected.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Deflectors[Activated')" cardset="" align="">Deflectors Activated</a></b><br>Choose an arena. This turn, when any of your units in that arena would be damaged, prevent 1 of that damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deflectors Activated prevents 1 damage each time a unit in the chosen arena is damaged (each damage instance). For example, if one of your units in the chosen arena suffers 2 damage, Deflectors Activated prevents 1 of that damage, reducing the damage to 1. If the same unit suffers another 4 damage later that turn, Deflectors Activated again prevents 1 of that damage, reducing the damage to 3.</li>
<li>If a Battle card (such as Unfriendly Fire) or ability (such as the one on Rebel Armored Freerunner) damages more than one of your units at once, Deflectors Activated prevents 1 damage to each of the units.</li>
<li>If you play 2 Deflectors Activated cards, the effects add up. This means you prevent 2 damage each time any of your units in the chosen arena takes damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Escape[Pod')" cardset="" align="">Escape Pod</a></b><br>As long as this unit is in the Space arena, if one of your Space units with a Pilot on it is discarded, you may move that Pilot to your build zone instead of discarding it. If you do, discard this unit from the Space arena.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you use Escape Pod's ability, the Pilot moves to your build zone. This doesn't tap the Pilot.</li>
<li>You can activate Escape Pod's ability only if the unit the Pilot is on is discarded.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Grand[Moff[Tarkin[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Grand Moff Tarkin (C)</a></b><br>As long as Tarkin is in the Character arena, you can't retreat your units during your retreat step.</p>
<ul>
<li>The restriction applies only during your retreat step. It doesn't stop cards or abilities that allow you to retreat during battle.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Han[Solo[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Han Solo (C)</a></b><br>When the roll for build points is made, if Han is in the Character arena, you get -1 build point this turn.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't receive less than 0 build points during a turn.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Hero@s[Potential')" cardset="" align="">Hero's Potential</a></b><br>Pay 4 Force  Choose one of your stacked unique units. Take any card in that stack and put it on top. When the turn ends, put that card on the bottom of the stack.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the turn ends, the card that was on top of the stack before Hero's Potential was played is returned to the top of the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Imperial[Landing[Craft')" cardset="" align="">Imperial Landing Craft</a></b><br>When you deploy this unit, choose one of your opponent's Ground units. If that unit is in the Ground arena when the battle phase starts, this unit does 2 damage to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>You choose the unit when you deploy Imperial Landing Craft. If that unit is in the Ground arena when the battle phase starts, Imperial Landing Craft does 2 damage to it. If it isn't in the Ground arena (for example, if it has retreated), this ability doesn't activate and Imperial Landing Craft does no damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Millennium[Falcon[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Millennium Falcon (B)</a></i></b><br>The <i>Millennium Falcon</i> can have an extra Pilot. When the battle phase starts, if the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> has a Pilot on it, you may remove 1 damage counter from the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>You can put 2 Pilots on the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i> Both Pilots must follow all the standard rules, including having the "Transport Pilot" ability.</li>
<li>Remove only 1 damage counter per turn (when the battle phase starts), only if you have 1 or more Pilots on the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i> If the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> has no damage counters, this ability has no effect.</li>
<li>If you have 2 Pilots on the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> you still remove only 1 damage counter from it.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Obi-Wan[Kenobi[(H)')" cardset="" align="">Obi-Wan Kenobi (H)</a></b><br>When Obi-Wan is discarded from the Character arena, you may search your deck. You may take a Luke Skywalker card from your deck and stack it under a Luke Skywalker in the Character arena. <i>(Follow normal stacking rules.)</i> Then shuffle your deck.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't have more than 4 cards in a stack. No 2 cards in the stack can be identical--that is, with the same name and version.</li>
<li>If you don't have a Luke Skywalker in the Character arena, you can't get a Luke Skywalker card from your deck.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rebel[Armored[Freerunner')" cardset="" align="">Rebel Armored Freerunner</a></b><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> This unit does 3 damage divided as you choose between 1 or 2 of your opponent's units in the Ground arena. Play only when this unit would attack.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the Rebel Armored Freerunner would attack, you can play its ability instead. You can divide the 3 damage in any way between 1 or 2 units. You can do either 3 damage to one unit or 2 damage to one unit and 1 damage to another unit.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('R2-D2[(D)')" cardset="" align="">R2-D2 (D)</a></b><br>Any Starfighter with R2-D2 on it can have an extra Pilot if that Pilot isn't an Astromech Droid.<br> {P} Starfighter Pilot. The Starfighter gets:<br> +10 speed.<br> Critical Hit 2.<br> When the battle phase ends, remove 1 damage counter from this Starfighter.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can place another Pilot (if it's not an Astromech Droid) on the Starfighter before or after placing R2-D2 on the Starfighter. The other Pilot must follow all the standard rules, including having the "Starfighter Pilot" ability.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Sabers[Locked')" cardset="" align="">Sabers Locked</a></b><br>Pay 1 Force  Choose one of your untapped Characters and one of your opponent's untapped Characters. Each player rolls one of his or her dice. If you roll lower, tap your Character. If your opponent rolls lower, tap his or her Character. If it's a tie, tap both Characters.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may choose Characters in any arena or build zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Second[Wave')" cardset="" align="">Second Wave</a></b><br>You may complete Second Wave only if you have no units in the Space arena and no Space units in your build zone. Put up to 3 Starfighter cards into the Space arena from your discard pile.</p>
<ul>
<li>Face-down cards in a build zone aren't units and have no effect on whether or not you can complete Second Wave.</li>
<li>The Starfighter cards put into the Space arena are now untapped units that can attack this turn and act like any other unit.</li>
<li>Putting the Starfighter cards into the Space arena doesn't count as having deployed or finished building them. No abilities can trigger on that.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Tatooine[Hangar')" cardset="" align="">Tatooine Hangar</a></b><br>As long as this unit is in the Ground arena, each of your Space units costs 1 fewer build counter to deploy.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can reduce the build cost of a unit to 0. The minimum build cost of a unit is 0. (You can't "gain" build points by using more than one copy of this unit and cheap Space units.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Trust[Your[Feelings')" cardset="" align="">Trust Your Feelings</a></b><br>Predict the number of hits you'll roll for this attack <i>(after any rerolls).</i> If you're correct, you gain +3 Force. Play only before you roll attack dice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your prediction is based on the number of hits you roll, not the amount of damage inflicted. Damage prevention has no effect on Trust Your Feelings.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Untamed[Ronto')" cardset="" align="">Untamed Ronto</a></b><br>When this unit attacks, your opponent may pay 2 Force. If your opponent does, he or she chooses a unit <i>(yours or your opponent's)</i> in the same arena as the defending unit. This unit now attacks the chosen unit instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your opponent must decide before you roll the Untamed Ronto's attack dice whether or not to pay the 2 Force.</li>
<li>Untamed Ronto can attack itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Vader@s[Fury')" cardset="" align="">Vader's Fury</a></b><br>Pay 6 Force  Choose one of your Starfighters in the Space arena. Each time that Starfighter attacks this turn, when its attack ends, choose a unit in the Space arena that it can attack but hasn't attacked this turn. The Starfighter attacks that unit. Play only when no unit is attacking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vader's Fury must be played before the Starfighter attacks, or it has no effect.</li>
<li>Vader's Fury allows your Starfighter to attack each of your opponent's units in the Space arena once. Your Starfighter can't use Vader's Fury to attack any individual Space unit more than once.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><i><b>Example:</b> You have Vader's TIE Fighter in the Space arena and your opponent has 3 Y-Wing Gold Two units and a Rebel Blockade Runner. You play Vader's Fury before Vader's TIE Fighter attacks. Then Vader's TIE Fighter attacks each of the 4 units in the order you decide.</i></blockquote>
<p><b><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Womp[Rat')" cardset="" align="">Womp Rat</a></b><br>When you deploy this unit, your opponent chooses and discards 1 card from his or her hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Units have no abilities during the setup of the game. The Womp Rat's ability doesn't activate unless you deploy it during a normal turn of the game.</li>
