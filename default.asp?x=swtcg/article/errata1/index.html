<p><a href="#q7"><h3>Questions</h3></a></p><br><br><br><a name="q1"></a><h3>Errata</h3>
<p>There are currently no new errata to any <i><b>Star Wars</b></i> trading card game cards.</p>
<h3>Rulings</h3><a name="q2"></a><p><b>General Rulings</b><ul><li></li>"Until end of battle" means "until the end of this turn's battle phase." Effects that last until end of battle last until the battles in all 3 arenas are over. <li></li>An attack starts at the moment you choose a defending unit. It ends after all damage prevention and triggered abilities. <li></li>You can't use the abilities of partially built cards. You have to deploy a unit before using its abilities. <li></li>Cards and abilities that do a number of dice of damage aren't attacks. Cards and abilities that affect attacks don't affect a card or ability that does a number of dice of damage. <li></li>An activated ability is any ability on a unit with the arrow symbol. It doesn't matter what the cost before the arrow symbol is--if it has an arrow symbol, it's an activated ability. Battle cards also use the arrow symbol. This doesn't make them activated abilities, because only units (Space, Ground, and Character) can have activated abilities. <li></li>"You gain +4 Force" means that you add 4 to your current Force total. It's a one-shot effect, so you add the 4 Force only once, when you play the card or ability <li></li>Unique unit cards refer to themselves by name. Unit cards that aren't unique use the phrase "this unit." But the card Nexu from the <i>Attack of the Clones</i> set was accidentally printed using its name, "Nexu," rather than "this unit." It is not unique, so its rules text should have used "this unit."</ul>
</p><a name="q3"></a><p><b>Abilities and Battle Cards with Multiple Parts</b><br><ul><li></li>If an ability or Battle card has multiple parts to its instructions, follow them in order. <li></li>If an ability or Battle card includes rolling dice or doing damage, chances for rerolling and preventing damage still happen--in the middle of the instructions on the ability or card. You don't follow all the instructions and then reroll dice and prevent damage. <li></li>Abilities that trigger while another card or ability is taking effect wait until it's finished taking effect. As usual, abilities that allow rerolls or prevent damage are special. They wait only until the next chance to prevent damage or reroll dice.</ul>
</p><a name="q4"></a><p><b>Triggered Abilities</b><br> Normally, you won't need to worry about any of these rulings. The situations that they cover won't come up in most games.</p>
<p><b>Triggered Abilities in General</b><br><ul><li></li>Some triggered abilities set up effects that happen later. The "<a href="default.asp?x=swtcg/article/errataenglishcards">overload</a>" abilities in the <i>Sith Rising</i> set are an example of this. <li></li>A triggered ability triggers only if all its "when" and "if" conditions are true. <li></li>When a triggered ability triggers, it joins the pool of triggered abilities waiting to take effect. Once it's in the pool, it's certain to take effect, even if one or more of its conditions stop being true. For example, a unit card that says "When the battle phase starts, if this unit is in the Space arena . . ." triggers only if the unit is in the Space arena when the battle phase starts. The ability will still take effect even if an ability that triggered when the battle phase started caused it to be discarded. <li></li>If more than one triggered ability is waiting to take effect, deal with all the Dark Side's abilities, then all the Light Side's abilities. So if one or more of the waiting abilities are from Dark Side units, they all take effect before the Light Side's waiting abilities, in any order chosen by the Dark Side player. If none of the waiting abilities are from Dark Side units, the Light Side player's waiting abilities take effect.</ul>
</p>
<p><b>"Held" Triggered Abilities</b><br> A triggered ability that's "held" is one that's waiting for a time when it can take effect. A triggered ability can't take effect while another card or ability is taking effect unless the triggered ability allows rerolls or prevents damage. <ul><li></li>Triggered abilities that allow rerolls can take effect only during chances to reroll dice. <li></li>Triggered abilities that prevent damage can take effect only during chances to prevent damage. <li></li>No other triggered abilities can take effect during chances to reroll dice or prevent damage. <li></li>While the effects of an ability (even another triggered ability) or Battle card play out, all waiting triggered abilities are "held" until after the effects are complete. <li></li>During a chance to reroll dice or prevent damage, all waiting triggered abilities are "held" until after that chance passes. Any abilities that trigger during the chance join the abilities already waiting and are also "held." <li></li>There are two exceptions to these rules: (1) Triggered abilities that allow rerolls aren't "held" during a chance to reroll dice (but are always held outside such a chance). (2) Triggered abilities that prevent damage aren't "held" during a chance to prevent damage (but are always held outside such a chance). <li></li>"Held" triggered abilities simply wait until they're not held anymore (usually after the current chance to play activated abilities and Battle cards) and then take effect normally.</ul>
</p>
<p><a name="q5"></a><b>Clarified Rules for Contested Unique Units</b><br> The rules for contested unique units in the Attack of the Clones and <i>A New Hope</i> rulebooks aren't completely clear and don't cover certain possibilities. So we've rewritten them. The new, improved rules for contested unique units are as follows:</p>
<p>If both players have a unique unit with the same name in battle at any time during the battle phase, the two units are contested.</p>
<p>When units are contested, players bid Force to win the contest. The bidding starts with the Dark Side player, who makes his or her first Force bid (of 0 or more). Then the Light Side player makes his or her first Force bid (of 0 or more). After that, bidding continues to alternate between the two players until neither player wants to raise his or her Force bid. Players can't bid more Force than they currently have.</p>
<p>When the bidding ends, each player adds his or her unit's total build cost and final Force bid. (Total build cost includes +1 for each card stacked under the unit.) The player with the higher total wins the bid. (The Dark Side wins ties.)</p>
<p>The winner of the contest pays Force equal to his or her final Force bid, and his or her unit stays in battle. The losing player pays no Force, and his or her unit retreats without tapping.</p>
<p>If there is more than one pair of contested units, the Dark Side player chooses which pair to bid on first.</p>
<p><a name="q6"></a><b>Activated Abilities</b><br> Activated abilities are separate from actual attacks. If a unit uses an ability that is played when it would attack, it is not considered to attack (unless the ability states that it is), and no abilities [triggered] off it attacking come into play. This also means that if you tap and zap, then you can&#8217;t be Rebel Surrendered. However, you must choose what you are doing when you would attack, and can&#8217;t change your mind later. (So if you were going to attack and were then hit you with a bunch of Gifts, you couldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Oh, then I want to use my ability.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the rules on activated abilities refer to abilities that increase power and other stats. It is not for abilities they use instead of attacks.</p>
<p>This means that Han Enchained does allow the unit to still use abilities like &#8220;tap and zap Yoda&#8221;; it also means that a "tap and zap" would work against a unit that has Han Enchained on it.</p><a name="q7"></a><h3>Questions</h3>
<p><b>Q:</b> How does it work when a card (such as Asteroid Field) causes damage against all units in an arena? Do you roll against each unit and hold all damage (and therefore damage prevention &#8220;play or passes&#8221;) until all units have been rolled against? Or do you roll against each unit separately, dealing with damage on one before moving on to the next; and if so, who decides the order?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> All of the dice are rolled, and then there is one total &#8220;play or pass&#8221; damage prevention, not one for each unit. The controller of the card that forced the roll is the one who chooses the order of the units.</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> How does the Vader&#8217;s Call Mission card work?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> You may pay any amount of Force up to X (X = the number of build counters on Vader&#8217;s Call). Your opponent discards this many cards.</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> According to the rules on activated abilities, if you have two units with Intercept and Retaliate, each could use them once per opportunity to play them. Each unit would then have the opportunity to Intercept and Retaliate on one attack. To my knowledge, Intercept does not cause a new attack, it simply shifts the current attack to a different person. Is this right?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> Yes, you can Intercept, use Retaliate, and then Intercept again.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Units A and B have Intercept and Retaliate. Unit C is attacking.</p>
<p>Unit C attacks unit A who Retaliates. Then unit B Intercepts and Retaliates. This gives unit A the opportunity to Intercept and receive the damage, if so desired. Each ability is used once, since there is only one opportunity provided by the one attack. This wouldn&#8217;t create a continuous loop, as there is only one attack to respond to; however, this would still be an effective way to do some extra damage (by spending a lot of Force).</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> Can Darth Vader (A) cause Obi&#8217;s Spirit to retreat from the Character arena? If you play Hope of Another on a Character, can Darth Vader (A) cause that Character retreat?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> Yes. You must be a Jedi Master to avoid the effects.</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> Can Darth Vader (G) tap to disrupt a Battle card even if no Battle card has been played? Can he tap to disrupt your own Battle card?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> Your Darth Vader (G) can&#8217;t disrupt a Battle card that hasn&#8217;t been played, but can disrupt one of your own Battle cards.</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> What happens if you have <i>Bright Hope</i> with a Ground card under it, then play Refit on Yavin on the <i>Bright Hope</i>?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> The card stays removed and has no effect afterward.</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> What happens if I apply Overkill to Hoth Battle Plains? If my Battle Droid Division rolls 4 hits, do I apply 8 damage to one unit, and then assign the remaining damage to another unit? Or do I apply 4 damage to one unit, and then double the remaining damage to another unit?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> The damage is only doubled when it resolves; so, you would only get to apply 4 damage that will then be doubled if it resolves.</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> Cloud City Landing Platform says: &#8220;When the roll for build points is made, you may reroll it once.&#8221; I also have a unit with an ability that begins "When the roll for build points is made . . .&#8221; Can I then use this ability twice in a single turn by using the Cloud City Landing Platform to reroll the build roll?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> You only get the effects off the final roll for build points.</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> When you play Self Destruct on a unit does its Retaliate cost anything?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> No.</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> I have a Jawa Sandcrawler and Forward Command Center in play. When it&#8217;s my turn to attack, do I have to tap the Forward Command Center when its speed 20 is checked and thus I can&#8217;t use his ability to increase the power of my Jawa Sandcrawler? (Can Forward Command Center use its ability on units that are slower than it is?)</p>
<p><b>A: </b> You could not use the Forward Command on the Jawa Sandcrawler, because you play it when that unit (the one whose power you want to increase) would attack. Since the Forward Command Center would be tapped before that, it doesn't work.</p><br><p><b>Q: </b> Two Location cards, Asteroid Field and Hoth Icefields, damage units in the Space and Ground arena respectively. Is the following the correct approach of resolving the damage: Damage is rolled against each unit, and the pending damage on each unit is noted. Once all damage rolls are complete, all the damage is resolved in one damage &#8220;play or pass&#8221;?</p>
<p><b>A: </b> All dice are rolled in the order the controller of the card chooses. Then both sides get damage prevention for ALL cards at once. They aren&#8217;t resolved separately.</p>
