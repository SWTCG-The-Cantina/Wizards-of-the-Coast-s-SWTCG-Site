<h3>Errata</h3>
<p>There are currently no errata to any <i>A New Hope</i> cards.</p>
<h3>Rulings</h3>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Admiral[Motti[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Admiral Motti (A)</b></a><br>Anytime a Jedi Character can attack Motti, that Character must do so. As long as Motti is in the Character arena, your Jedi Characters can attack Motti.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Jedi Characters must attack Motti if they can.</li>
<li>Your opponent's Jedi Characters must attack Motti if they can.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Blaster[Barrage')" cardset="" align=""><b>Blaster Barrage</b></a><br>Pay 5 Force  For this attack, you may divide the damage done by the attacking unit between the defending unit and another of your opponent's units in the same arena as the defending unit. Play only when one of your units is attacking <i>(before you roll attack dice).</i></p>
<ul>
<li>You must play Blaster Barrage before dice are rolled. When you play it, choose the unit that you plan to damage in addition to the defending unit. Once the dice have been rolled (and rerolled), you can divide the damage up between the defending unit and the other unit.</li>
<li>You can choose to do 0 damage to either of the two units.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Contingency[Plan')" cardset="" align=""><b>Contingency Plan</b></a><br>Remove all build counters from each partially built card in your build zone. You get that many extra build points this turn.</p>
<ul>
<li>The units from which you remove the build counters are still considered "partially built," even though they have no build counters on them.</li>
<li>You can spend the build points you get in any way you choose.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dannik[Jerriko[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Dannik Jerriko (A)</b></a><br>Stun 3 <i>(When Dannik damages another unit, that unit gets -3 power until end of turn.)</i> When Dannik damages a Character, remove 1 damage counter from Dannik.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove 1 damage counter each time Dannik damages a Character.</li>
<li>You can't remove more than 1 damage counter each time Dannik damages a Character, even if he does 2 or more damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Vader[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Darth Vader (A)</b></a><br>When Vader attacks a Character other than a Jedi Knight or Jedi Master, you may pay Force equal to that Character's total build cost. If you do, that Character retreats when Vader's attack ends. Pay 2 Force  Evade 2 <i>(Prevent up to 2 damage to Vader.)</i><br> Pay 1 Force  Intercept <i>(If a unit is attacking one of your Characters in the same arena as Vader, it now attacks Vader instead.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>You must pay the Force for Vader's first ability when he attacks. If you pay the Force, the unit will retreat after the attack (if it's still in the Character arena). If Vader attacks a Jedi Knight or Jedi Master, the ability does nothing--you can't even pay the Force.</li>
<li>The "total build cost" of a stack is the build cost of the top card, plus one for each card stacked underneath it.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><b>Q: </b> Can Darth Vader (A) cause Obi&#8217;s Spirit to retreat from the Character arena? If you play Hope of Another on a Character, can Darth Vader (A) cause that Character retreat?<br><br><b>A: </b> Yes. You must be a Jedi Master to avoid the effects.</blockquote>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Demonstration[of[Power')" cardset="" align=""><b>Demonstration of Power</b></a><br> Each of your Dark Side units that currently has power 5 or more gets +3 power until end of turn.</p>
<ul>
<li>This card cares about the power of your Dark Side units only at the time you play it. If those units' power changes later in the turn, its effect on them doesn't change.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Desperate[Confrontation')" cardset="" align=""><b>Desperate Confrontation</b></a><br>Each of your units gets "Pay 1 Force  This unit gets +2 power for this attack" until end of turn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each unit can use the ability once per attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dianoga[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Dianoga (A)</b></a><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> Choose an untapped Character with power 4 or less. Tap that Character. Play only during battle.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Play only during battle" means that you can play the ability at any time you could normally play a Battle card. You don't have to wait until Dianoga attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Elite[Stormtrooper[Squad')" cardset="" align=""><b>Elite Stormtrooper Squad</b></a><br>Critical Hit 1 <i>(This unit does 1 more damage if you roll at least one natural six.)</i><br>Accuracy 1 <i>(Add +1 to each of this unit's attack dice.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy doesn't help you get a Critical Hit--you still have to roll a natural six.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Imperial[Blockade')" cardset="" align=""><b>Imperial Blockade</b></a><br> Mission<br> To complete Imperial Blockade, you must also pay 8 Force.<br> Your opponent can't spend build points this turn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any unspent build points are lost. They don't carry over from turn to turn.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Imperial[Manipulation')" cardset="" align=""><b>Imperial Manipulation</b></a><br> When the battle phase starts, move 1 damage counter from one unit to another unit in the same arena. <i>(This can't be prevented.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Moving damage counters isn't the same as doing damage. You just take a damage counter and put it onto a different unit.</li>
<li>You can move the damage counter onto one of your opponent's units or from one of your opponent's units to another of his or her units.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('It@s[Not[Over[Yet')" cardset="" align=""><b>It's Not Over Yet</b></a><br>Pay 5 Force  Choose an arena. Untap all units in that arena. Fight another battle in that arena. Play only if all units in all arenas are tapped.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Fight another battle in that arena" means that you take another battle step for that arena.</li>
<li>The units in that arena get to attack again.</li>
<li>Anything that triggers at the start of the appropriate battle step will trigger.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jump[to[Lightspeed')" cardset="" align=""><b>Jump to Lightspeed</b></a><br>Return one of your units from the Space arena to your hand. <i>(Also return all cards stacked with it and its Pilot, if any, to your hand.)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>You can play this card even if the unit you want to return is being attacked.</li>
<li>You can't play this card after dice have been rolled, because it doesn't allow you to reroll dice or prevent damage. (Those are the only things you can do after dice have been rolled.)</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke[Skywalker[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Luke Skywalker (A)</b></a><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> Search your deck. You may take a Luke Skywalker card from your deck. Show it to your opponent and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your deck. Play only during your build step.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can take any card named Luke Skywalker. You can't take a card with any other name, like Luke's X-wing.</li>
<li>You can get any version of Luke Skywalker, even another Luke Skywalker A.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke@s[Speeder[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><b>Luke's Speeder (A)</b></a><br>Discard Luke's Speeder from the Ground arena  Show one of your partially built Space unit cards to your opponent. Put 3 build counters on it. Play only during your build step.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Character can still be affected by cards and abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Penetrate[the[Shields')" cardset="" align=""><b>Penetrate the Shields</b></a><br>One of your units gets +3 power for this attack if it's attacking a unit with Shields.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check to see if the defending unit has Shields only at the time you play this card. If the defending unit loses Shields or if a unit without Shields becomes the defending unit, your unit keeps the +3 power.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rebel[Blockade[Runner')" cardset="" align=""><b>Rebel Blockade Runner</b></a><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> Draw a card.

<li>This card's second ability works no matter why your opponent causes you to discard it from your hand.</li>
<li>The second ability doesn't do anything if one of your effects causes you to discard this card from your hand.</li>
<li>When its second ability takes effect, this unit isn't "deployed"; it's just "put into the Space arena."</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rebel[Crew[Chief')" cardset="" align=""><b>Rebel Crew Chief</b></a><br><img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> Show one of your partially built Starfighter cards to your opponent.

</ul>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rebel[Marine')" cardset="" align=""><b>Rebel Marine</b></a><br>This unit can't attack if you have no units in the Space arena.</p>

<ul>
<li>If dice were rerolled, use the last roll to see if your opponent rolled any hits.</li>
<li>No dice are rolled for a unit with 0 power, so your opponent rolls no hits for such a unit.</li>
<li>You can play this card only if your opponent rolled no hits. If your opponent rolled any hits but the damage was prevented, this card still can't be played.</li>
