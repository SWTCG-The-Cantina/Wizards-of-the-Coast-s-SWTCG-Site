<p>It's hard to believe, but the final installment in the <i>Star Wars</i> saga is drawing near. Funny how time seems to slip away from you. 1977 doesn't seem that long ago. I was only nine years old back then and watching <i>Star Wars</i> for the first time. At that time, there was no Episode IV: <i>A New Hope</i>, it was simply <i>Star Wars</i>. My biggest thrill came from playing with my <i>Star Wars</i> figures and listening to the movie's soundtrack, trying to recreate those fantastic scenes. Instead of baseball cards, I collected the <i>Star Wars</i> movie cards. I would take my weekly allowance to the store as soon as I got it and buy a pack of cards and, of course, chew the bubblegum that came with it. Fast-forward 20 years, a marriage, a house payment, a baby, a good job, and the word of a new <i>Star Wars</i> movie. Not just a movie, but a whole new trilogy of movies to tell the backstory of what we already knew was coming -- Anakin Skywalker's journey from Jedi Knight to Sith Lord. Wow! I almost felt like I was nine years old again.</p>
<p>Now we're on the brink of the final installment of this great saga. And we have new cards to tease us for what's in store once May 19th rolls around. Let's look at two new cards -- Combined Squadron Tactics and Darth Sidious (E) -- to help bring out that nine-year-old inner child.</p>
<p>My first two <b><i>Star Wars</i> TCG</b> articles (on the <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/deckstarterslars">Lars</a> and the <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/deckstarterslars">Ewoks</a>) featured ideas to help you spice up your existing decks or give you a starting point for new decks, so I'll try to share some helpful ideas using these two new cards from <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>. Granted, there are more cards from this set that may provide a better combo, but for now let's focus on what these new ones can offer to our existing stock.</p>
<h3>Combined Squadron Tactics</h3><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_rotspreviews1b_picMain_en.jpg"><p>First up, we have Combined Squadron Tactics. The first thing that we saw after Episode IV's opening crawl was a small space battle (albeit quite one-sided) over Tatooine. Rumor has it that <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> will open up with a huge space battle over Coruscant; if the image on this card is any indication, it will be one heck of an opening! But I digress, back to the card at hand. This Neutral beauty will prove to be useful in any decks where Space will be a priority. For 4 Force, you get to add +3 power to three of your Space units, provided they all have different speeds. This will provide a much needed boost to some of those low power units, such as TIE Fighters, that already have decent speed but lack any real punch.</p>
<p>Since it's neutral, the Light Side will find Combined Squadron Tactics just as useful. I'm thinking of a stacked <i>Falcon</i>, a Luke's X-wing, and maybe even an Obi-Wan's Starfighter... Does the 4 Force sound a little steep? Try combining this with <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Cloud[City[Battleground')" cardset="" align="">Cloud City Battleground</a> to knock that cost down by 2 Force. If you're playing Light Side, also add in <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Home[One[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><i>Home One</i> (A)</a>, and now the cost is down to 1 Force.</p>
<h3>Darth Sidious (E)</h3>
<p>Now we have the baddest man in the dang galaxy -- Darth Sidious (E). His stats are fairly average for a 6 build character unit: 40 speed, 6 power, and 5 health just in case he has to stand and fight. His "Pay 3  Evade 2" isn't that great, but he'll likely have an apprentice to back him up and hopefully soak up damage.</p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_rotspreviews1b_pic1_en.jpg"><p>His real power comes in the form of the direct damage ability: "Pay 3 Force, <img src="/images/Symbols/tap.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Tap" border="0"> Put 3 damage counters on any Ground or Character unit and 1 damage counter on Sidious (Placing damage counters cannot be prevented.) Play only during your build step." <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Imperial[Manipulation')" cardset="" align="">Imperial Manipulation</a> just became his new best friend. After taking the 1 damage himself, now he can send it over to another unit in the Character arena, maybe even one that he just dropped those 3 damage counters on. With a lot of good cards that only have 4 health, here's a chance to take them out of the game.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that Darth Sidious will be able to use this ability during your build step, thus allowing you to complete this dirty deed before the Light Side has a chance to play a card like <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Disturbance[in[the[Force')" cardset="" align="">Disturbance in the Force</a> to prevent you from playing activated abilities during battle. The cost of 3 Force to do this can be hefty early in the game. Cards such as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Capture[Obi-Wan')" cardset="" align="">Capture Obi-Wan</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Maul@s[Strategy')" cardset="" align="">Maul's Strategy</a> and other Force-generators will come in quite handy. Of course, if you're going to go with <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Maul@s[Strategy')" cardset="" align="">Maul's Strategy</a>, why not get the most out of it and team Sidious up with his former apprentice: Darth Maul. Hey, two Darths are better than one!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed seeing these two new cards to add to those already spoiled. Remember back to when you first saw <i>Star Wars</i>: <i>A New Hope</i> and try to reconnect with that inner child. He wants to play cards as well as see the movie. Until next time, this is Rogue 9 standing by...</p><br><p><i>Thoughts or comments?
