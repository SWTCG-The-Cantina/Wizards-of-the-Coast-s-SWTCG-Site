<p>There are currently no new errata to any <i><b>Star Wars</b></i> trading card game cards.</p><br><br><br><h3>Rulings</h3><a name="q2"></a><p><b>General Rulings</b><ul><li></li>"Until end of battle" means "until the end of this turn's battle phase." Effects that last until end of battle last until the battles in all 3 arenas are over. <li></li>An attack starts at the moment you choose a defending unit. It ends after all damage prevention and triggered abilities. <li></li>You can't use the abilities of partially built cards. You have to deploy a unit before using its abilities. <li></li>Cards and abilities that do a number of dice of damage aren't attacks. Cards and abilities that affect attacks don't affect a card or ability that does a number of dice of damage. <li></li>An activated ability is any ability on a unit with the arrow symbol. It doesn't matter what the cost before the arrow symbol is--if it has an arrow symbol, it's an activated ability. Battle cards also use the arrow symbol. This doesn't make them activated abilities, because only units (Space, Ground, and Character) can have activated abilities. <li></li>"You gain +4 Force" means that you add 4 to your current Force total. It's a one-shot effect, so you add the 4 Force only once, when you play the card or ability <li></li>Unique unit cards refer to themselves by name. Unit cards that aren't unique use the phrase "this unit." But the card Nexu from the <i>Attack of the Clones</i> set was accidentally printed using its name, "Nexu," rather than "this unit." It is not unique, so its rules text should have used "this unit."</ul>
</p><a name="q3"></a><p><b>Abilities and Battle Cards with Multiple Parts</b><br><ul><li></li>If an ability or Battle card has multiple parts to its instructions, follow them in order. <li></li>If an ability or Battle card includes rolling dice or doing damage, chances for rerolling and preventing damage still happen--in the middle of the instructions on the ability or card. You don't follow all the instructions and then reroll dice and prevent damage. <li></li>Abilities that trigger while another card or ability is taking effect wait until it's finished taking effect. As usual, abilities that allow rerolls or prevent damage are special. They wait only until the next chance to prevent damage or reroll dice.</ul>
</p><a name="q4"></a><p><b>Triggered Abilities</b><br> Normally, you won't need to worry about any of these rulings. The situations that they cover won't come up in most games.</p>
<p><b>Triggered Abilities in General</b><br><ul><li></li>Some triggered abilities set up effects that happen later. The "<a href="default.asp?x=swtcg/article/errataenglishcards">overload</a>" abilities in the <i>Sith Rising</i> set are an example of this. <li></li>A triggered ability triggers only if all its "when" and "if" conditions are true. <li></li>When a triggered ability triggers, it joins the pool of triggered abilities waiting to take effect. Once it's in the pool, it's certain to take effect, even if one or more of its conditions stop being true. For example, a unit card that says "When the battle phase starts, if this unit is in the Space arena . . ." triggers only if the unit is in the Space arena when the battle phase starts. The ability will still take effect even if an ability that triggered when the battle phase started caused it to be discarded. <li></li>If more than one triggered ability is waiting to take effect, deal with all the Dark Side's abilities, then all the Light Side's abilities. So if one or more of the waiting abilities are from Dark Side units, they all take effect before the Light Side's waiting abilities, in any order chosen by the Dark Side player. If none of the waiting abilities are from Dark Side units, the Light Side player's waiting abilities take effect.</ul>
</p>
<p><b>"Held" Triggered Abilities</b><br> A triggered ability that's "held" is one that's waiting for a time when it can take effect. A triggered ability can't take effect while another card or ability is taking effect unless the triggered ability allows rerolls or prevents damage. <ul><li></li>Triggered abilities that allow rerolls can take effect only during chances to reroll dice. <li></li>Triggered abilities that prevent damage can take effect only during chances to prevent damage. <li></li>No other triggered abilities can take effect during chances to reroll dice or prevent damage. <li></li>While the effects of an ability (even another triggered ability) or Battle card play out, all waiting triggered abilities are "held" until after the effects are complete. <li></li>During a chance to reroll dice or prevent damage, all waiting triggered abilities are "held" until after that chance passes. Any abilities that trigger during the chance join the abilities already waiting and are also "held." <li></li>There are two exceptions to these rules: (1) Triggered abilities that allow rerolls aren't "held" during a chance to reroll dice (but are always held outside such a chance). (2) Triggered abilities that prevent damage aren't "held" during a chance to prevent damage (but are always held outside such a chance). <li></li>"Held" triggered abilities simply wait until they're not held anymore (usually after the current chance to play activated abilities and Battle cards) and then take effect normally.</ul>
