<h3 class="subheading">Featuring designer Richard Garfield</h3>
</td></tr></table><br><br><p><b>wizo_talisman:</b> Have a hankering to learn about Wizards of the Coast's new <i>Star Wars</i> trading card game? Get your questions answered from the man who invented the genre. Trading Card Game Designer Richard Garfield is here with us at Wizards Presents!</p>
<p><b>darksbane_the_dragon:</b> Will there be mechanics now and in the future that allow you to do things such as blow up the Death Star, freeze Han, or win a podrace?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> The mechanics of the game are flexible enough to allow these things I believe. I imagine these things will happen-especially blowing up the Death Star!</p>
<p><b>thalas_illivan:</b> Would you explain the system's mechanics in general?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> It is tough to give a concise answer to the question about how the game works, because it is unlike other games out there. For example, if asked about Harry Potter, I would talk about it in terms of <b>Magic</b>. But, with <i>Star Wars</i> it is very different.</p>
<p><b>thalas_illivan:</b> Is it at all similar to any games, even including RPG's, or the Decipher <i>Star Wars</i> games?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> The game is a battle raging in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, taking place in three theatres: space, ground, and character combat. Once you have won two out of three of these theaters you have won the game.</p>
<p><b>vinadelmar:</b> Where does stacking cards come in and what purpose does it serve?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> Stacking cards came from the idea that characters should be bigger than a single card. I didn't like the idea of a rich character being reduced to a single card, so I constructed a system by which the character cards are stacked and thereby improve over the course of the game. For example, you might have "Luke-Moisture Farmer," "Luke-Space Pilot," and "Luke-Jedi Master." These would all contribute in different ways. This way we can also have characters everyone recognizes available in all decks, while still having cool rare characters.</p>
<p><b>darksbane_the_dragon:</b> In an interview you said you have always wanted to do a trading card game that uses dice. What is it specifically about dice that made you want to do this? </p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> I wanted to do a dice game, because I felt there was a lot of unexplored game design territory there. I have been working with a "no dice" standard for so long that I have been accumulating dice mechanics that are just bursting to get out. I think it is appropriate for a game like this as well. In <b>Magic</b> it's ok for bears to always beat goblins. However, in a character-based game, I thought uncertainty would be welcome. As far as initial reaction, I guess I am not surprised: card players I feel are in general bias against dice. But, I think dice have as much scope for skill (playing backgammon or a miniatures game should prove that). And I feel that the game mechanic will win over a lot of folks who might not think the like dice games.</p>
<p><b>wizo_talisman:</b> How much of the game is based on Episode II content and how much reflects the other four movies?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> I believe the first set is almost entirely Episode II. That was the plan at least, but I haven't seen the final card list after development.</p>
<p><b>achtung_bubba:</b> First, are you involved in the way the game changes through expansion sets or just this initial creation? Also, I want to collect the cards before May 16 but remain more-or-less spoiler-free. Is this possible?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> My role is primarily to develop the overall game system. Afterwards I usually take part in some expansion design, but I don't do a lot of that. I enjoy working on expansions, however, because it's fun working in established game systems. The only reason I don't do it more is because there are a lot of folk here that are very good at that. As for your second question: I don't know if it is possible!</p>
<p><b>bacabachaui:</b> How will various versions of stacked character cards come to affect the game differently? What happens to the damage counters if so? Do they follow the stack or the card?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> The damage is assigned to the stack and not the card and the size of the stack is relevant (like adding one attack per card). As for the details, I can't say because they got switched about a lot in development to get it balanced, and so I am not sure where it settled.</p>
<p><b>scotbot:</b> We have character cards in the character arena, but how about characters in the space and ground arenas? Is there an Obi-Wan in a Jedi fighter?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> Yes, characters can affect all the arenas.</p>
<p><b>Loneyjfan:</b> Will most or all of the cards have game text? If so, how much?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> In playtesting, we had characters that could pilot spacecraft or command armies, giving those units special advantages. We also had tap abilities that affected the different arenas. It's important to note that there are other units that affect different arenas: ships that can bombard ground units, ground based things that affect space, etc. Trading card games are all about variety after all!</p>
<p><b>darksbane_the_dragon:</b> Can you expand on the concept of the Force in this game? </p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> The Force is used to pay for a lot of effects in the game, like  increasing the accuracy or size of an attack. For example, a lot of characters have "Force: Evade." This means you spend a Force point to avoid one or more points of damage. This makes it so characters are pretty robust.</p>
<p><b>jundlandchris:</b> Can you elaborate on the breakdown of the first set, chase cards, foils, rarity level, and so on?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> Sorry, I really can't. All of those decisions are finalized after design. I imagine the rarity levels will be similar to <b>Magic</b>-that is a formula that has worked well for us. I don't know what was going to be done with foil though.</p>
<p><b>netcowboy:</b> I would just like to say 'thank you' to Mr. Garfield for all of the fun over the years! I am wondering if you would elaborate on the connection between this game and the old Avalon Hill game Titan.</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> Titan is an awesome game subtitled "Monster Slugathon Fantasy Wargame." The combat was terrific, and involved rolling lots of dice, but still required a lot of skill. In particular, a high power creature would roll a lot of dice, while a high skill creature hits on a certain number. Plus, there is a visceral feeling of power when you attack with a powerful creature-rolling eighteen dice for a serpent's attack feels powerful. I attempted to capture this feeling in the <i>Star Wars</i> card game.</p>
<p><b>vinadelmar:</b> Why are there so few cards? The first set has 180 cards and the first expansion only has 90 cards? Will there be multiplayer rules?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> I don't know why the sets are so small. Actually, I thought the sets were larger, but I am sure if you read this, your source is more accurate. As far as multiplayer rules, I expect there will be, at the very least a team game. We wanted to focus on the two-player game up front and make sure we could run a good tournament. </p>
<p><b>Jundlandchris:</b> It's been years since you designed <b>Magic: The Gathering</b>, and it was a pioneer of the genre. Has a lot of what you learned from <b>Magic</b> applied to design of <i>Star Wars</i>? What were the things that worked well and what are things to avoid? </p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> I have worked on perhaps six trading card games since <b>Magic</b>. Each time I have tried to play with the boundaries and see what can be changed and how that affects the game. I would say that <b>Magic</b> has affected my design the most, because it is the most widely studied and developed and has proven to be very robust. The sort of things I take from <b>Magic</b> are an attempt to give game depth, not through rules complexity, but through combinations of simple rules. I also believe that short games are a lot better TCGs. Some of my early games were long, which was fine for a board game, but not for a trading card game. The whole idea about TCGs is changing your deck and playing again. If the game is long then you don't have time to do that.</p>
<p><b>achtung_bubba:</b> As I understand it, when you're customizing your deck, if you group together a lot of Obi-Wan's in the hopes of stacking them, the advantage is more power to the stack. Is there a disadvantage that would encourage a player to have a team of characters rather than a stack of one? Are you required to stack your duplicate characters?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> You certainly have to stack your characters (we don't want multiple Obi-Wans floating around). You have plenty of reason to play multiple characters, though. The growth of stacking is not going to be as good as putting out new characters in general, and if a card effect hoses a character...well you will want two characters at least. The thing I wanted to avoid is you playing four Obi-Wans and then getting gypped when you drew your second one. I hated the idea of stacking your deck with a particular character to make sure he/she comes out. If you are playing a lot of the character cards and they each add to the characters depth, however, you can reliably get your favorite characters.</p>
<p><b>scotbot:</b> I understand that this game has different levels of complexity for different levels of gaming experience or age. Is this true?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> The basic game is just a battle-you put out your ships, armies, and your characters and you slug it out. The advanced game adds a reinforcement step and a card play step. So, between rounds of slugging it out, you play mission cards and add new armies, ships, and characters, before moving them in and out of the battles.</p>
<p><b>darksbane_the_dragon:</b> The speed values seem to be a very important part of the game, but their scale seems to be a little strange compared to other numbers on the card. Care to elaborate on the reason for using such high numbers?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> Well when I designed the game the scale wasn't so wonky.
There are two reasons for the big speeds. First, since speed is only used to determine the order in which things move, it allows us to easily add, say, a 5 speed and have the effect of adding 1/2 if we hadn't multiplied the numbers by 10. Second, since we have effectively multiplied the numbers by 10,which allows us to make +1/2 speed cards (we probably wouldn't want to add fractions). The only role for speed is determining what order the units strike in each round, which is simple, but important.</p>
<p><b>loneyjfan:</b> How much and what kind of game text will cards have? Is Anakin Skywalker's game text about the norm?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> I am not sure. My guess is that the cards are going to begin like Anakin. In fact, Anakin looks pretty simple relative to a lot of the characters I have seen. However, what we want is a game where the cards are not individually complex but give a deep game play in their combination.</p>
<p><b>vinadelmar:</b> What would you consider to be "The Cards to Have?" Also, are there any concepts like instants or interrupts in this game?</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> As far as the cards to have, I don't know where the final set ended up. When I was playing the design version "Turbolaser" and "Ground Bunker" was really good. Those might not be in this set, or under those names, though. There are instant cards that can be played that swing battles, for example, and cards that negate those.</p>
<p><b>netcowboy:</b> I am wondering about the storytelling aspect of the game. When you play, does it feel as though a story played out, or is it more about strategic combat? In any event, it sure looks fun.</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> I think as you play, you feel like one of the battles that <i>Star Wars</i> is famous for is taking place. There is fighting going on in space, on the ground, and with lightsabers. There is a feeling of interconnectedness-if your ground combat fails, then the shields that protect your ships will fall. The broader story elements to <i>Star Wars</i> will be in the game, but less pronounced. You might play mission and event cards that suggest intrigue, adventure, romance or betrayal.</p>
<p><b>wizo_talisman:</b> A special thank you to Richard Garfield for taking the time to answer everyone's questions about the new <i>Star Wars</i> Trading Card Game. I'm sure everyone's looking forward to seeing what's in store for them in April.</p>
<p><b>richard_garfield:</b> Thank you all for your interest and it was a pleasure talking about the game. I am really looking forward to seeing it out there, since I think it is so different than existing games.</p>
