<p><i>This spring, SW:TCG will see the release of </i>Revenge of the Sith<i> -- and with it, a new rulebook. Michael Mikaelian continues his coverage of exactly what this rulebook will contain, what's been added, what's been changed -- this time looking at the Lucky mechanic.</i></p>
<p>While Henry Stern, Wizards of the Coast R&amp;D lead developer for the <b><i>Star Wars</i></b> TCG, had a list of topics he wanted the <i>Star Wars</i> Guru discussion group members to tackle for the <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> rulebook, those topics weren&#8217;t the only things discussed by the group. One topic pondered deeply&#8212;some felt a little too deeply&#8212;was the Lucky ability.</p>
<h3>Not All Luck is Good</h3>
<p>Currently, Lucky X is defined as: &#8220;Each attack, you may reroll X of this unit&#8217;s attack dice, or have your opponent reroll X attack dice against it.&#8221; The #1 detail that escaped many players reading this ability for the first time was its lack of the words &#8220;up to.&#8221; Without that modifying phrase, there&#8217;s the potential for some unpleasant situations. A unit with Lucky 2 or greater must reroll that many dice if the player chooses to use the Lucky ability. Choosing to reroll fewer dice is not an option.</p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_rulescolumn0207_picMain_en.jpg"><p>For example, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin[Skywalker[(J)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin Skywalker (J)</a>&#8217;s Pilot ability that gives his unit Lucky 2 is great&#8212;when the Dark Side rolls two or more hits against Anakin&#8217;s unit. When a Dark Side unit rolls multiple dice and only scores one hit, now the Light Side has a lot of thinking to do. Does the Light Side player use Lucky to reroll two dice from the attack&#8212;a hit and a miss&#8212;or just take the hit?</p>
<p>If an attacking unit has Critical Hit, Accuracy, or some other nasty attack-related ability, using Lucky to reroll a hit and a miss could increase the damage. Is this really in the spirit of the Lucky ability? While the <i>Star Wars</i> Guru group didn&#8217;t think so, there was some concern about how adding &#8220;up to&#8221; would make this already useful ability too good. A unit with multiple Lucky abilities could reroll the same die twice, not reroll any misses, and would never be forced to reroll hits.</p>
<h3>Processing&#8230; Processing&#8230;</h3>
<p>Statistically speaking, Lucky is good. It turns a 50% chance of a single die rolling a hit into a 75% chance of success. That&#8217;s if it&#8217;s used only once on that die. Two Lucky abilities influencing the same die increase the chance of success to 83%. And that&#8217;s only if the attacking unit doesn&#8217;t have Accuracy. Defensively, the odds are inverted: one roll yields a hit 50% of the time; two, 25% of the time; and three, 17% of the time. Against a unit with Armor and two Lucky abilities, the chances of hitting are almost nonexistent.</p>
<p>The group slung around a lot of math to support all of this. Here are some examples of what they were subjected to in the name of research.</p>
<p><b>Chances of a Lucky unit hitting with a single die roll, by method:</b></p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tr><td><b>Type of Roll</b></td>
<td><b>X+Y (one reroll)</b></td>
<td><b>X then Y (two rerolls)</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Accuracy 0 (normal attack)</td>
<td>75.00%</td>
<td>87.50%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Accuracy 1</td>
<td>88.90%</td>
<td>96.30%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Accuracy &#8211;1 (or vs. Armor)</td>
<td>55.60%</td>
<td>70.40%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Natural 6 (reroll any result)</td>
<td>30.60%</td>
<td>42.10%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>(reroll misses only)</td>
<td>25.00%</td>
<td>29.20</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><b>X+Y</b><br>h/6 + (h/6*m/6)</p>
<p><b>X then Y</b><br>h/6 + (h/6*m/6) + (h/6*m/6*m/6)</p>
<p><b>h</b> = number of different possible hit results<br><b>m</b> = number of different possible miss results</p>
<h3>The X-Y Debate</h3>
<p>The working term for using one Lucky ability, seeing the results, and then using a second Lucky ability was dubbed the &#8220;X then Y&#8221; method. &#8220;X then Y&#8221; seemed quite powerful in theory, and had the advantage of being the way it&#8217;s currently done. Another proposed method, &#8220;X+Y,&#8221; called for all of a unit&#8217;s Lucky abilities to combine into one Lucky value. Such a unit can only use Lucky once per attack, and each increment of Lucky can only affect a different die.</p>
<p>&#8220;X then Y&#8221; gives low-power Lucky units incredible punch. They&#8217;re not quite Accuracy 3 units, but they might as well be. One thing Lucky can do that Accuracy can&#8217;t is give the player extra chances to trigger a Critical Hit. &#8220;X then Y&#8221; excels at this. Rerolling the same die twice in hopes of a Critical Hit increases the odds from 17% to 31% of the reroll coming up a 6. &#8220;X then Y&#8221; also outperforms Armor when defending against low-power units. Armor protects against damage 66% of the time. If every attack die is covered by Lucky, it protects 75% of the time. If each die is double covered, say hello to 83% protection. &#8220;X then Y&#8221; doesn&#8217;t perform nearly as well when used with greater power values, but low-powered units are far more common in <b><i>Star Wars</i></b> TCG.</p>
<p>&#8220;X+Y&#8221; puts a limit on this odds stacking. In order for this method to work, however, Lucky must include the phrase &#8220;up to.&#8221; If it doesn&#8217;t, the ability becomes even more counterintuitive: You&#8217;d rather have a Lucky 2 Pilot on a Space unit than one with Lucky 1. Together, you could only reroll three dice, not two or one.</p>
<p>After the first table comparing &#8220;X then Y&#8221; to &#8220;X+Y&#8221; circulated, Henry let us know not to worry too much about it. It was pretty clear that &#8220;X+Y&#8221; was preferable. Starting with the release of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>, Lucky will read: &#8220;Each attack, you may reroll up to X of this unit&#8217;s attack dice or have your opponent reroll up to X attack dice against it.&#8221; The glossary also makes it clear that you add all of a unit&#8217;s Lucky abilities together before rerolling any attack dice.</p><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_rulescolumn0207_pic1_en.jpg"><h3>What About Bad Luck?</h3>
<p>Another idea that came up was the concept of a negative Lucky value. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Greedo[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Greedo (B)</a> has Accuracy &#8211;1, why not define what Lucky &#8211;X would mean while there&#8217;s a chance to get it into a rulebook? In essence, Lucky &#8211;X would give the other player&#8217;s unit Lucky X when the &#8220;Unlucky&#8221; unit was attacking or defending. This seemed like a perfect ability for Greedo or a version of Boba Fett based on his last film encounter with Han Solo. Despite its potential as a space saver, however, Lucky &#8211;X does not appear in the <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> rulebook.</p>
<p>Noodling how Lucky should be played was just a warm-up for our next topic: turn order.</p><br><br><p><i>Thoughts or comments? Visit the message board thread for this article <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=5406650#post5406650"> here</a>.</i></p>
