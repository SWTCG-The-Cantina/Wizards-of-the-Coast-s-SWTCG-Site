</div><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_featureYMTC2_picMain_en.jpg">Well, we'll be honest and say that it didn't come as much of a surprise that Character won the first round of voting. We were also very glad to see that Ground made a run for it as a lot of people were no doubt drooling at the chance to make an AT-AT (or our personal favorite, the Tauntaun Squadron!). <p> So Character it is. Even though we now know the basic idea of what we're going to make together, there's still a very wide range of options to choose from. The first of which is we have to decide what affiliation to make this Character. <i>Empire Strikes Back</i> introduces so many new characters for all three affiliations, that its going to be a hard choice deciding which one to pick. Because once you start down a path, forever will it dominate... your... well... you know. </p>
<p> We just can't stress enough how important this choice is. This is all up to you. We urge you to take some time and really think about what you want. You should be thinking down the road as well... what kind of abilities do you think of ... what ideas come to your head depending on what affiliation you choose? </p>
<p> Once you've come to a decision, then cast your vote and we'll start tracking. We'll tally your votes and announce next week what you've decided and go from there.</p>
<p>So join us each week as <b>You Make The Card</b>!</p>
<p> For those who are curious, here's the results from Step One.</p>
<table><tr><td><img border="0" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_featureYMTC2_pic1_en.jpg"></td>
<td><b>Question: What type of card do you want to make?</b><p>
<li>Character - 130 votes</li>
<li>Ground - 73 votes</li>
<li>Space - 62 votes</li>
<li>Battle - 27 votes</li>
<li>Mission - 19 votes</li>

<td valign="top"><b>You Make The Card - Step Two</b><p>What affiliation do you want the Character to be?</p>
<p>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Dark</li>
<li>Neutral</li>
</p>
<p> Keep in mind that you are designing a character card based on a character from the movie <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, so for example, if you select light as your affiliation, you're then be limited to creating a character who was affiliated with the light side at some point in that film.</p>
