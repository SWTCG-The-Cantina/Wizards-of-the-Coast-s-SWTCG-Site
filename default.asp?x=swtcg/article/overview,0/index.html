<p><b>An 

Introduction to the <i>Star Wars</i> Trading Card Game</b></p>
<p>Climactic Battle.</p>
<p>It's a term that 

describes that intense conflict at the end of a <i>Star Wars</i> movie when the balance of the Force is on 

a razor's edge. It's that point when the fate of the galaxy rests on the choices of those involved - when 

even the smallest victory can lead to triumph for either the light or the dark side of the 

Force.</p>
<p>Starfighters clash for supremecy in space, while on land opposing armies face off in desperate 

maneuvers to gain ground; and further still, deep within the conflict, is the duel of the fates between the 

very forces of good and evil.</p>
<p>It is the excitement of this three-fold conflict that makes the 

<b><i>Star Wars</i> Trading Card Game</b> the ideal way to plan and execute the high-stakes gambits and 

intense action of a climactic <i>Star Wars</i> battle. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Star Wars</i> TCG</b> holds all the 

weapons, characters and ships necessary to recreate the intensity and action of the <i>Star Wars</i> 

movies. You can experience the lightsaber duels, the desperate space battles and the pitched ground 

assaults when you form your own battle groups and plans. Whether you play for the light or dark side of the 

Force, you will ultimately choose which elements from the <i>Star Wars</i> universe you will use in your 

plan to crush the opposition in one fell swoop. </p>
<p>With the <b><i>Star Wars</i> TCG</b> you will have 

the ability to make the conflicts as simple or complex as you want them. With variations in rules and 

setup, there is simplicity balanced with strategy for all levels of play. While the initial game comes with 

all the characters, starships, and ground troops you need to win each theater of battle, you can choose to 

add and re-mix your own battle forces to fit your tactics and strategies. But, remember that even the 

greatest of plans can be laid to waste if you do not use the Force wisely.</p>
<p>When the game launches in 

April, it will contain content based on the upcoming <i>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</i> movie. Future 

expansions will cover the remaining films as well as content from the <i>expanded universe</i>.</p>
<p>In 

the months following the release of the <b><i>Star Wars</i> TCG</b> you will have the opportunity to prove 

yourself in combat when Wizards of the Coast launches the <b><i>Star Wars</i> TCG</b> Organized Play 

programs. These events will introduce new and exciting stakes to the climactic battles you 

create.</p>
<p>Join us in the following weeks as we take a closer look into the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG. Every 

week we'll bring you more information about the units, strategies, and tactics that will allow you to 

recreate the excitement of <i>Star Wars</i>.</p>
<p>May the Force be with you, always.</p>
