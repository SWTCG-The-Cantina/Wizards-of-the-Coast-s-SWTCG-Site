<p>Light Side characters just seem to live longer than Dark Side characters. Around here, even an overload attack by Darth Maul hasn't been working with any sort of regularity anymore. Then Maul gets mauled by Mace or a stacked Chewbacca. Sometimes the Light Side makes you think you have a chance in Character with just a Commander Willard and R2-D2. No problem for Darth Vader and Aurra Sing; they can take &#8216;em out. Then they up and play <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lull[in[the[Fighting')" cardset="" align="">Lull in the Fighting</a>.<br> If the above sounds familiar, then this is the deck for you. </p>
<p>The Light Side has a much easier time generating Force than the Dark Side, so naturally they're going to have the edge in the Character arena, where it's usually "He with the most Force wins." Stealing Force is the Dark Side's usual tactic, but I made this deck to test a new strategy for winning the Character arena. </p>
<p> The Character arena is where most of the tricks in this deck are found. Let me first start off by saying that this deck utilizes four <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lull[in[the[Fighting')" cardset="" align="">Lull in the Fighting</a> battle cards. However, I don't plan on using them to run and hide. Instead, I plan on attacking the Light Side unmercifully, while avoiding any counterattacks. There are two versions of Darth Vader that can still be quite effective in hurting the opposition even after a Lull has been played. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Vader[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Vader (A)</a> has the ability to forcibly retreat a character (as long as it isn't a Jedi Knight or Master), by paying Force equal to their build cost. This ability requires him to attack, but Lull doesn't stop him from attacking, just from doing damage. Sometimes the Light Side might use a Lull to protect a lone character, so this can be a way to victory if they aren't in both of the other arenas as well. If there's a small Light Side unit hiding under the Lull, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Vader[(F)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Vader (F)</a> can simply pay 4 Force, tap and discard it if it's Health score is 3 or less. It's not damage, so the Lull doesn't stop it. </p>
<p> The other way to do damage to the Light Side without fear of counterattack is to use the <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Assassin[Droid[ASN-121[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Assassin Droid ASN-121 (A)</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Tyranus[(D)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Tyranus (D)</a>. If they are the fastest units out there, they can both use their tap abilities to do damage to the opposition, then play a Lull yourself to prevent any counterattacks. You can get away with this as Lull says you must play it before any unit attacks. Tap abilities aren't attacks, but they deal damage, so they can't be utilized if the Light Side plays a Lull or if another unit is faster. The key is making sure that they are faster than anything else out there. The easiest way is by using <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dark[Speed')" cardset="" align="">Dark Speed</a> and this deck packs four of them. But the more interesting way to make sure you're characters are faster is to use <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Elan[Sleazebaggano[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Elan Sleazebaggano (A)</a>. The +20 Speed he provides comes at a price&#8230; or does it. If you use the tap abilities and then play the Lull afterwards, the damage he deals to your characters will be prevented. There's another trick Elan is good for, if you have a lot of Force. If Elan, Aurra, and Tyranus (A) are present, let Elan deal 1 point to them, then Deflect that damage over to the Light Side. Each turn you'll have to size up the opposition and determine which of the tricks will work&#8230; and that can be tricky itself. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_decks22_pic1_en.jpg"></p>
<p> The Ground arena is much more straightforward. With <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dark[Speed')" cardset="" align="">Dark Speed</a> in the deck, I decided that a whole bunch of efficient 40 Speed units would work best, as the +30 Speed will ensure that they can attack first. Attacking first with a 7 Power unit like a <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Juggernaut')" cardset="" align="">Juggernaut</a> often spells doom for the ever-present Jedi Heroes or Assault Walkers. Backing them up are a couple of <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Destroyer[Droid[Squad')" cardset="" align="">Destroyer Droid Squad</a>s. Since these guys often manage to take the arena, the deck can afford a bunch of utility units as well. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Tatooine[Hangar')" cardset="" align="">Tatooine Hangar</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jawa[Sandcrawler')" cardset="" align="">Jawa Sandcrawler</a> are great in that department. </p>
<p> In Space, the deck uses mostly smaller units so they can be deployed in numbers, hopefully discounted by the Hangar. However, if the Light Side doesn't manage to make much of a showing in Space, a single <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Imperial[Star[Destroyer')" cardset="" align="">Imperial Star Destroyer</a> can force them to come back or pay the consequences. Efficient mid-sized unique units are found here, as well. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Tyranus@s[Solar[Sailer[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Tyranus's Solar Sailer (A)</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Sith[Infiltrator[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Sith Infiltrator (A)</a>, and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Slave[I[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Slave I (A)</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Slave[I[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Slave I (B)</a>. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Slave[I[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Slave I (A)</a> is especially useful as it combos extremely well with a Mission card this deck employs: <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Imperial[Manipulation')" cardset="" align="">Imperial Manipulation</a>. </p>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Imperial[Manipulation')" cardset="" align="">Imperial Manipulation</a> works very well with the theme of this deck. The Manipulation is a great way to either destroy a damaged unit before it gets a chance to attack, force it retreat, or set it up for a <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Padawan@s[Deflection')" cardset="" align="">Padawan's Deflection</a>. If you haven't noticed by now, the deck has many ways of throwing damage back at the Light Side and it doesn't even use Retaliate. But the big daddy of retaliation isn't even a Retaliate card. It's <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Countermeasures')" cardset="" align="">Countermeasures</a>. Annoyed by The X-Wing Assault Squad, AT-TE Assault Walker or other big Light Side units with Critical Hit or Accuracy? This is THE way to take &#8216;em down. I don't recommend using it on any unit that rolls less than six dice, unless it has Crit and even then I wouldn't go much lower. </p>
<p> Remember the Deflect trick with Elan? That also works if they manage to damage themselves, say by a Brutal Assault. So not only do you roll an extra five dice, but for 2 Force you can tack an extra point of damage on any opposing unit. It also works well when used on an already-overloading <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Droid[Starfighter[DFS-1VR')" cardset="" align="">Droid Starfighter DFS-1VR</a>. Eleven dice in Space can drop even the mighty <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Luke@s[X-wing[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Luke's X-wing (B)</a> in one blow. Sometimes the best way to get past all of the Light Side Evade abilities is to deny them their Force. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Your[Powers[are[Weak')" cardset="" align="">Your Powers are Weak</a> is the way to do it. At 6 Build you'll want to build one up over time, then finish it when the build roll is a 1. That will hopefully catch the LS without enough build to <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Seek[the[Council@s[Wisdom')" cardset="" align="">Seek the Council's Wisdom</a>. To make sure the deck can find the cards it needs, a couple of <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Price[of[Failure')" cardset="" align="">Price of Failure</a>s do the trick. Feel free to use it on Elan once the Character arena has been decisively taken. </p>

<p><b> Strategy Advice </b></p>
<p> After seeing your initial hand, you should definitely mulligan any Mission cards in hand as they aren't as useful early on. Same with <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Countermeasures')" cardset="" align="">Countermeasures</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Padawan@s[Deflection')" cardset="" align="">Padawan's Deflection</a>. It's a good idea to save Elan and the Assassin for later turns to get some surprise value out of them, that is, unless you have all the pieces of the combo together including a Lull. A good starting setup (subject to LS plays) would be Tyranus (D) with (A) understacked, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Aurra[Sing[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Aurra Sing (A)</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Juggernaut')" cardset="" align="">Juggernaut</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Jawa[Sandcrawler')" cardset="" align="">Jawa Sandcrawler</a>, and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Tyranus@s[Solar[Sailer[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Tyranus's Solar Sailer (A)</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_decks22_pic2_en.jpg"></p>
<p> Try to hold onto combos sets like <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dark[Speed')" cardset="" align="">Dark Speed</a> and Lull to utilize in the same turn. Also, if you don't have a Lull, it's a good idea to retreat the Assassin Droid when Elan is present, unless you think you can win the game that turn. </p>
<p> I first tested the deck with <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Unfriendly[Fire')" cardset="" align="">Unfriendly Fire</a>, but reduced that to the <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Padawan@s[Deflection')" cardset="" align="">Padawan's Deflection</a> as saving up the Force was tough when the deck has so many tricks that use up Force in Character. This deck has a lot of ways to win and has a good chance of winning in any arena. There are plenty of components that work well in huge combos or on their own, so there is plenty of room for substitutions to be made. You can't get much trickier than this deck, so anything you do to modify it will certainly make it easier to play&#8230; and play against.</p>
