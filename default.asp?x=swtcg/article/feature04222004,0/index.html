</div><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_feature04222004_picMain_en.jpg"><p>In a <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/featureTopDownDesign">previous article</a>, we introduced the concepts of &#8220;Mechanics Driven&#8221; and &#8220;Top Down&#8221; when it came to <i><b>Star Wars</b></i> TCG design. Mechanics Driven starts with a new game mechanic and decides where it best works in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. Top Down takes the opposite approach&#8212;it starts with the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, and then figures out what mechanics fit best within it.</p>
<p>For <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i>, we wanted to show something of the expansion&#8217;s design process. From the bounty hunters, to the creatures&#8212;to a certain Imperial Admiral&#8212;Top Down design features heavily. Here&#8217;s where:</p>
<h3>Bounty Hunters: Good Pay for Good Work</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the bounty hunters themselves, the marquee stars of this expansion. True, they only receive a few moments of actual screen time, but remain some of the most popular characters, with their legends and backstories fleshed out in <i>Tales of the Bounty Hunters</i> and other Expanded Universe material.</p>
<p>For the bounty hunters, this expansion brings two key mechanics that fit extremely well with their characters: Bounty and Upkeep. With Upkeep, bounty hunters must be paid for their work&#8212;and paid well (even Vader offered them a substantial reward). Upkeep can&#8217;t even be avoided by retreating a bounty hunter. For their price, however, the bounties they earn bring you valuable build points, more cards, or even take a named Character completely out of the game.</p>
<h3>Individual Hunters: A Rogue&#8217;s Gallery</h3><img border="0" align="left" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_feature04222004_pic1_en.jpg"><p>Taking things a step further, Top Down design also went into the individual bounty hunters.</p>
<p>According to his backstory, Dengar suffered horrible injuries during a swoop race, turning to the Empire for surgical repairs. This lent itself well to <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dengar[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Dengar (A)</a>: earning bounty to have all damage counters removed.</p>
<p><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Garindan[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Garindan (A)</a> also fits his screen character. As the agent who tipped off the Imperials to Docking Bay 94, it made sense to give Garindan some kind of bounty appropriate for a spy; in this case, he allows you to see your opponent&#8217;s hand (similar to another neutral spy, <i>Battle of Yavin</i>'s <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Labria[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Labria (A)</a>).</p>
<p>Prince Xizor, leader of the Black Sun criminal organization, became one of the more memorable villains in the Expanded Universe novels. To reflect the flavor of a crime boss, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Prince[Xizor[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Prince Xizor (A)</a> completely mitigates the Upkeeps of your other neutral units. However, this also means only units that would pay Upkeep receive Xizor&#8217;s boons of +10 speed and +1 Power.</p>
<p>With <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Greedo[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Greedo (B)</a>, his abilities didn&#8217;t come through his strengths so much as his particular shortcomings. True, he brings good Power and Health to the Character arena&#8212;but the bounty hunter who missed Han at point blank range? That&#8217;s Accuracy &#8211;1 you read on his card, not Accuracy 1. Hey, not all bounty hunters can be as successful as Fett!</p>
<h3>Of Space Slugs (Imperial and Otherwise)</h3><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_feature04222004_pic2_en.jpg"><p>Beyond the bounty hunters, other cards in <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i> also shared a Top Down approach. On the Dark Side, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Admiral[Firmus[Piett[(C)')" cardset="" align="">Admiral Firmus Piett (C)</a> showcases those skills helpful to an Imperial Admiral. Not only does he effectively control Space units, giving them: &#8220;Pay 0 Force  Intercept&#8221;, but his: &#8220;Pay 1 Force  Retreat Piett&#8221; came from his knack of surviving Lord Vader&#8217;s particular managerial style.</p>
<p>To distinguish them, unique Characters are each given a nickname in playtesting. As &#8220;&#8230;the administer of this facility,&#8221; <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Lando[Calrissian[(G)')" cardset="" align="">Lando Calrissian (G)</a> became known as &#8220;the Don of Bespin&#8221;&#8212;and was thematically linked with his Speed, Power, and Health determined by the number of other Bespin units in any arena.</p>
<p>We also wanted to give players more critters for their creature decks. As mentioned in the <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/cotd/1002">April 15 card-of-the-week</a>, this included <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Dune[Sea[Krayt[Dragon')" cardset="" align="">Dune Sea Krayt Dragon</a>, as well as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Bantha[Herd')" cardset="" align="">Bantha Herd</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Sleen')" cardset="" align="">Sleen</a>, and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Enraged[Wampa')" cardset="" align="">Enraged Wampa</a>. It also meant a second <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Space[Slug')" cardset="" align="">Space Slug</a>, with the ability to tap other Space units and keep them tapped&#8212;in other words, to eat those ships that wandered too close! Space Slug helps round out creature decks otherwise lacking Space units&#8212;and comes from a Top Down design that not only fit its screen presence, but made an excellent transition to the <i><b>Star Wars</b></i> TCG.</p><br><p>We hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this look at <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i> design&#8212;and best of luck keeping your bounty hunters in line!</p>
