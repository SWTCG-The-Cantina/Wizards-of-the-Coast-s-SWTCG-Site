<table><tr><td valign="top">Part of the excitement in playing a trading card game is that new cards are always on the horizon. There are always new abilities and new characters to look forward to and someone is always coming up with something creative to build new game features around. Arguably one of the best jobs here at Wizards is working on the R&amp;D team that helps create these new and exciting cards. Well, now we'd like to offer you that job! <p>For the first time in the history of the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG you will have the chance to help create a card that will appear in the upcoming November expansion, The <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>.</p>
<p>Every week your voice will be counted and heard as the <i>Star Wars</i> design team works on the cards that are going to appear in that expansion. Specifically, your decisions will help create a card that will appear in that set where the final card is a compilation of your collective input.</p>
<p>We'll be tallying your votes and announce here what you've decided as we progress through all the steps of creating a card.</p>
<p>So join us each week as <b>You Make The Card</b>!</p>

<p>We have reviewed all submissions and have selected the final card concepts!</p>
<hr>
<p><b>You Make The Card - Step Five</b><br>Select Your Favorite Card Concept:</p>
<p><li>(A) - When Mara Jade attacks, if her attack deals damage equal to one-half the target's health or more (after damage prevention), tap that unit. - 15</li>
<li>(B) - At the start of battle, if Mara Jade is in the Character arena, look at your opponent's hand. Choose one card. Your opponent discards that card, and then he or she draws a card. - 14</li>
<li>(C) - Pay 2 Force {A} Choose one of your opponent's Jedi. Mara Jade deals 1 damage to that unit. This damage cannot be evaded. You may use this ability as often as you like, when no unit is attacking. - 25</li>
<li>(D) - If Mara Jade is in the character arena at the end of the battle phase, the Light Side builds first on the following turn. - 34</li>
<li>(E) - When you finish building Mara Jade (or during your first build step if you built her during set up), choose a Character. Mara Jade gets +4 power when attacking that Character. - 44</li>
<li><b>(F) - At the end of battle in the Character arena, remove all damage counters from Mara Jade. Your opponent loses 1 Force for each damage counter removed. - 84</b></li>
