<p>At first, this unit may not look too good. 6 build for a 4-power unit without any activated abilities? 6 build will purchase quite a lot these days, and this just seems to be in the wrong market. But, since when does a fighter wing attack by itself? Start deploying this unit alongside a variety of support ships and blam!, you have a powerhouse that can take down anything!</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s look at this unit&#8217;s strengths. 50 speed and 8 health are good values for a 6 build unit. It may not get to attack first, but it will certainly not go last and will stay around for quite some time.</p>
<p>Weaknesses? Well apart from its low power, the Republic Fighter Wing does not have any damage evasion properties. No Armor, no Evade and no Shields.</p>
<p>The solution?</p>
<p>Swarm!</p>
<p>The trick to using the Republic Fighter Wing effectively is to surround it with a number of low-cost units that both bolster the Wing's power and minimize its weaknesses. I see this unit fitting perfectly into Rebel decks that swarm in space with units such as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('X-wing[Red[Three')" cardset="" align="">X-wing Red Three</a> that can Intercept potentially fatal attacks. Add to this such tricks as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Rebel[Hangar')" cardset="" align="">Rebel Hangar</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Guardian[Mantis[(A)')" cardset="" align=""><i>Guardian Mantis</i> (A)</a>, and you have a very nasty unit that will certainly make its voice heard!</p>
<p>We hope you have enjoyed this sneak peek into the new set!</p>
