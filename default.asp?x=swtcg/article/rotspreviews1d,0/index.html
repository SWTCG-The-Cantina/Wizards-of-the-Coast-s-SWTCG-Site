<p>Anakin Skywalker has been a troublesome fellow.</p>
<p>The fact that he contests with Darth Vader prevents most players from entertaining the idea of putting Anakin into their constructed Light Side decks as the big guy in black armor remains a favorite of Dark Side players. With both great Force denial and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Vader[(K)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Vader (K)</a> tipping the scales at 10 build, it's extremely likely that the Dark Side player will win any Vader vs. Anakin contest.</p>
<p>Don't totally discount our young top gun, though. The Anakin units offer great versatility at low costs -- especially as Pilots. Plus, <i>The Phantom Menace</i> and <i>Return Of The Jedi</i> have pushed many Dark Side players into fielding Darth Sidious, Palpatine or Darth Maul instead of the original bad guy, reducing those arena-dominating contests.</p>
<p>Anakin also just got a whole lot better.</p>

<p>6 build for a 50 speed, 5 power and 5-health unit with 2 abilities is great value for money -- and just look at those abilities! OK, the Evade is a little weak, but first turn can see you rolling 11 dice for an unstacked character! Plus, the power boost ability does not have any drawbacks, unlike earlier versions on cards such as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Darth[Maul[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Darth Maul (A)</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin[Skywalker[(E)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin Skywalker (E)</a>.</p>
<p>Anakin Skywalker (L) is a solid pick in Limited, and as a common there's a good chance of finding him within your packs.</p>
<p>Next, the sirens head your way&#8230;</p>
