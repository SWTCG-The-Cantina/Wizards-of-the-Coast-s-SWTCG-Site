<table><tr><td valign="top">In what was one of the closest polls we've ever had to recount, the Dark side barely nudged out Neutral to make it to round 3 of You Make The Card. So now that we have started down this path, forever will it dominate the card's destiny!<p>In a way, it is very fitting that the Dark side is the character card we will build for the <i>Empire Strikes Back</i> because this movie represents the true power of the Dark side. When we started looking at the characters in the movie and their significance with the events that took place, we started to narrow down our list to the main Dark side characters we can really have fun with. The list below represents the cast from which we are allowed to choose for this set but offers a wide variety of card ideas.</p>
<p>Obviously Vader is a natural choice as this is his moment to shine. Piett and Veers both have strong roles in commanding the forces of the Empire. The probot is a key tool at hunting down the Light side while the snowtroopers were highly trained assault specialists. The most intriguing option is Mara Jade who would soon accept the assignment of hunting down Luke Skywalker.</p>
<p> Once you've come to a decision on who you want to see made into a card, then cast your vote and we'll start tracking. We'll tally your votes and announce next week what you've decided and go from there.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that with some of the basic decisions now behind us, the voting is going to get a little more intense. So we're going to be taking a little bit of time between polls to make sure that we can incorporate the card design with the upcoming set.</p>
<p>Join us each week and we'll keep you up to date on the prograss as <b>You Make The Card</b>!</p>

<p> Keep in mind that you are designing a character card based on a character from the movie <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, so for example, if you select Darth Vader as your character, you'll be creating a version of Vader as he was seen at some point in that film.</p>
