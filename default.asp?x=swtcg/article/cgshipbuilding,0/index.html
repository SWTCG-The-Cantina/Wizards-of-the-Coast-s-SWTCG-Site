<p><i>While </i>Rogues and Scoundrels <i>adds the &#8220;scum and villainy&#8221; of more bounty hunters to the Character arena, it also launches their ships&#8212;from </i>Slave 1<i> to the </i>Virago<i>&#8212;into Space. Jonathan W. Hill, freelance CG-shipbuilder for the <b>Star Wars</b> TCG, contributed the following article on himself and the incredible artwork he&#8217;s created for the game. As Jonathan writes:</i></p>
<p>I&#8217;m fortunate to be able to work within the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. There&#8217;s that &#8220;cool factor&#8221; when people find out what I do for a living. It somehow justifies my obsession. Signing cards for people is a strangely rewarding sensation.</p>
<p>I like to immerse myself in projects I&#8217;m working on, which isn&#8217;t a problem with the <i><b>Star Wars</b></i> TCG. I still regularly play <i>X-wing Alliance</i> among other <i>Star Wars</i> video games, and while working I often listen to the <i>Star Wars</i> Radio Drama or many of the audio books from the <i>Star Wars</i> novelizations. I&#8217;ve had a red Imperial insignia tattooed on my chest, next to my heart, for over a decade now. The only contradiction to this is that I was almost a Jedi. No, not in the <i><b>Star Wars</b> Galaxies</i> game (not yet anyway), but in the TCG.</p>
<p>You see, in an upcoming expansion my face was originally texture mapped onto the pilot of a CG Jedi Starfighter image I was creating. I even had a proposed Jedi name: Jonah-Tan and my astromech sidekick H1-LL. You have to admit it is a <i>Star Wars</i>-sounding name, but alas&#8212;it didn&#8217;t make it into the card description. During the approval process Lucasfilm also had the Starfighter&#8217;s windows darkened so that you couldn&#8217;t see the pilot (though I&#8217;m still in there&#8230;).</p>
<h3><i>Attack of the Clones</i></h3><img border="0" align="left" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_cgshipbuilding_picMain_en.gif"><p>The <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i> card set is definitely my second favorite set to date&#8212;my favorite being the initial <i>Attack of the Clones</i> set that launched the TCG; after all, it allowed me to see concept designs for the movie six months before the film&#8217;s release. <i>Attack of the Clones</i> was also the most terrifying set. It was my first foray into card art, and it was for <i>Star Wars</i>, one of the most highly coveted licenses in existence. I had a near impossible deadline of less than a month, over Christmas, to create six ships (including the <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Techno[Union[Starship')" cardset="" align="">Techno Union Starship</a> and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Speeder[Bike[Squadron')" cardset="" align="">Speeder Bike Squadron</a>) and the now iconic Clone Trooper.</p>
<p>The opportunity to work on anything in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe was a lifelong dream. When the offer came I immediately said &#8220;yes&#8221; without hesitation. It wasn&#8217;t until after I hung up the phone that the gravity of what I&#8217;d agreed to weighed in. My wife, Adrienne, and I decided Christmas would have to be postponed until January.</p>
<p>I spent a sleepless December, working from Industrial Light &amp; Magic&#8217;s concept art for ships that their modelers hadn&#8217;t finished, and spent a lot of time trying to second-guess what their models would look like. Needless to say, I finished everything on time. I likely wouldn&#8217;t still be working on the game if I hadn&#8217;t. After all was done, I still had a perfectionist&#8217;s feeling about my work: It could have done better, there were things I&#8217;d like to change. Maybe Wizards of the Coast will someday let me do &#8220;Special Edition&#8221; versions of those cards as well.</p>
<h3>Tools of the Trade</h3>
<p>I use Discreet&#8217;s 3D Studio Max as my primary 3D modeling and rendering program. Although I have used Maya for a few cards, 3DS Max serves me well. Once I receive the art assignment, I gather my reference, play games for awhile, and then start modeling the basic shape of the ships. My first pass is done with basic primitive objects and extruded shapes. When I&#8217;m comfortable with the form and volume, I render off several camera angles and send them to the Art Director at Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p>Then I begin to actually model the ship based on the preferred camera view. Since these are still images, there&#8217;s not always a good reason to model the entire ship. When the modeling is done I submit an untextured gray model for approval by Wizards of the Coast and Lucasfilm.</p>
<p>If they approve the card, I paint the textures for the ship. I&#8217;m constantly refining my texturing methods with each project. Sometimes I paint the textures on paper and scan them into the computer; the majority of the time, however, I use either Corel Painter or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<h3><i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i></h3><img border="0" align="left" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_cgshipbuilding_pic2_en.gif"><p>The <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i> set is definitely one of the coolest expansions so far. The neutral faction adds a great dynamic to gameplay and gives us a glimpse into some of the characters and vehicles from the <i>Star Wars</i> Expanded Universe. I enjoyed working with the bounty hunters&#8217; ships&#8212;especially the <i><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Virago[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Virago (A)</a></i>, which was built based on the unassembled plastic model kit I had laying around. This set gave me the opportunity to explore the bounty hunter facet of the mythology and take a deeper look at the <i>Shadows of the Empire</i> story.</p>
<p>In many cases this is the first time some of these ships have been seen as tangible 3D designs. It was a lot of fun working on these untapped craft&#8212;my favorite ships to work on are actually those that didn&#8217;t appear in the movies. I enjoy bringing to life the little thumbnails in comic books, or building a ship from a few lines of description. One of my favorites was the Corellian <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('YV-664[Light[Freighter')" cardset="" align="">YV-664 Light Freighter</a>, one of several unseen designs pulled from the Lucasfilm archives. Like us all, I&#8217;d love to rummage through that closet!</p>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
<p>In each card set, I select one ship as the signature piece. This is the one card that is either really cool and deserves more attention, or a ship that needs a little extra effort to make it cool. (For <i>Rogues and Scoundrels</i>, this was the <i><a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Outrider[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Outrider (A)</a></i>. I actually built it before the card set was designed, knowing that someday Wizards of the Coast would have to include it!) In the end I always try to stay true to the <i>Star Wars</i> mythology that has inspired me throughout my life and career. I hope that my ships help you in your games.</p>
<p>I currently work from home in Alberta, Canada, with my lovely wife, Adrienne, and our 4-year old twins (boy and girl). No, she wouldn&#8217;t let me name them Luke and Leia. Their names are Gavin and Vaughan. Take care. <br><br> &#8212;Jonathan W. Hill</p><br><table><tr><td><i>A look at the</i> Outrider<i>, from gray model to finished card:</i></td>
