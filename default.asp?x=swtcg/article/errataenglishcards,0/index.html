<h3 class="subheading"></h3>
<p align="right" class="byline"><i></i></p>
<p><a href="#q1"><b><h3>Errata</h3></b></a></p>
<p><b><h3>Rulings</h3></b><a href="#q2">New Abilities</a><br><a href="#q3">Specific Cards</a></p><br><br><br><a name="q1"></a><h3>Errata</h3><br> There are currently no errata to any <i>Sith Rising</i> cards.<br><br><br><h3>Rulings</h3><br><br><a name="q2"></a><b>New Abilities</b><p><b>Stun</b><br> Stun X <i>(When this unit damages another unit, that unit gets -X power until end of battle.)</i><ul><li></li>If all the damage is prevented, Stun doesn't kick in. <li></li>Stun works any time the unit damages another unit, not just if the damage is from an attack. <li></li>If a unit attacks another unit that has Stun and Deflect (and the second unit deflects the damage), the unit that the damage is Deflected to loses power because of Stun (because the deflected damage was done by the unit with Stun and Deflect). <li></li>If a unit with Stun attacks another unit that has Deflect, but not Stun (and the second unit deflects the damage), the unit that the damage is Deflected to doesn't lose any power because of Stun (because the deflected damage was done by a unit that doesn't have Stun).</ul>
</p>
<p><b>"Overload" Abilities</b><br> An "overload" ability lets you give a unit a bonus to its power when it attacks. Each time it attacks and uses this ability, it damages itself at the end of its attack: "When this unit attacks, you may give it +X power for that attack. If you do, when the attack ends, that unit does Y damage to itself." <ul><li></li>The unit doesn't damage itself until the end of the attack. <li></li>You can prevent, evade, and deflect the damage, just like any other damage. <li></li>The power bonus lasts only until the attack ends. <li></li>If the unit attacks again, you can use the ability again. The unit gets the power bonus again, and it damages itself again at the end of that attack.</ul>
</p>
<p><a name="q3"></a><b>Specific Cards</b></p>
<p><b>Aurra Sing</b> A <i>(Sith Rising)</i><br> Character - Bounty Hunter<br> Treat Aurra as a Dark Jedi.<br> When Aurra damages a Jedi and that Jedi is discarded, untap Aurra. <i>(She can attack again.)</i><br> Pay 2 Force {A} Deflect 1 <i>(Prevent 1 damage to Aurra, and Aurra may do that much damage to a unit of your choice in the Character arena.)</i><ul><li></li>Any card that looks for a Jedi or Dark Jedi will see Aurra Sing as a Jedi, even though she doesn't have the word "Jedi" on her type line. This is true even if her card is in your deck, hand, or discard pile. <li></li>Any time Aurra damages a Jedi, if that damage causes the Jedi to be discarded, you must untap Aurra. (She untaps every time she kills a Jedi.) You don't untap her if she damages a Jedi and that Jedi isn't discarded immediately, but is then discarded later on in the turn.</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Careful Targeting</b><i>(Sith Rising)</i><br> Battle<br> Pay 1 Force {A} Choose a unit with Shields. Until end of battle, that unit's Shields don't work. <ul><li></li>Completely ignore the unit's Shields ability. <li></li>All Shields abilities on the unit stop working, whether they're printed on it or it gets them some other way.</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Clone Captain</b><i>(Sith Rising)</i><br> Character - Clone Soldier<br> Put any number of damage counters on one of your other Clones in any arena {A} Prevent that much damage to this unit. <ul><li></li>You can't split the damage from an attack among more than one of your Clones. You can play this ability only once each time a source would damage Clone Captain. <li></li>You can't prevent damage to those Clones in any other way, either. You're putting damage counters on them, not doing damage to them.</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Concentrated Fire</b><i>(Sith Rising)</i><br> Mission<br> When the battle phase starts, choose one of your opponent's units in the Space arena. Concentrated Fire does 4 dice of damage to that unit. <ul><li></li>You don't choose the unit until the battle phase starts, so your opponent can't stop you from doing so unless he or she retreats all his or her units from the Space arena. <li></li>If your opponent retreats all his or her units from the Space arena, Concentrated Fire does nothing.</ul>

Play only during your build step. <ul><li></li>For a normal unit, the "total build cost" is just the unit's build cost. For a stacked unit, the "total build cost" is the build cost of the top card of the stack, plus 1 for each card under that card.</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Darth Tyranus</b> D <i>(Sith Rising)</i><br> Character - Dark Jedi Master - Sith Lord<br> {tap}, Pay 2 Force {A} Choose one of your opponent's units in the Character arena.

Play only when Tyranus would attack.<br> Pay 3 Force {A} Evade 3 <i>(Prevent up to 3 damage to Tyranus.)</i><ul><li></li>Tyranus's first ability isn't an attack. <li></li>For Tyranus's first ability, you don't roll dice. The ability always does 4 damage to the Character you choose. <li></li>With Tyranus's first ability, your opponent can play Battle cards and other abilities to prevent the damage, even if the Character you choose isn't a Jedi Master.</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Fog of War</b><i>(Sith Rising)</i><br> Mission<br> For each unit in the Space, Ground, and Character arenas <i>(yours and your opponent's),</i> roll one of your dice.

</p>
<p><b>Padmé Amidala</b> E <i>(Sith Rising)</i><br> Character - Naboo Diplomat<br> As long as Padmé is in the Character arena, each Light Character costs 1 fewer build counter to deploy. <ul><li></li>If you can deploy a unit for 0 build counters, you don't have to put a build counter on it when you start to build it. If you do this, you must deploy it as soon as you can. This is a clarification of the rule in the Attack of the Clones rulebook.</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Republic Drop Ship</b><i>(Sith Rising)</i><br> Ground - Republic Gunship<br> When you deploy this unit, you get +2 build points this turn.<br> Shields 1 <i>(Each unit gets -1 power as long as it's attacking this unit.)</i><ul><li></li>If you put the Republic Drop Ship into an arena during setup, you don't get the +2 build points. <li></li>If you partially build the Republic Drop Ship at the end of setup, you get the +2 build points when you deploy it.</ul>

If you do, return it from your discard pile to your hand. <ul><li></li>You have to pay the 2 Force as soon as the Sith Infiltrator is discarded from the Space arena. You can't wait and pay it later in the turn or during a later turn.</ul>
</p>
