<h2 class="headline">Star Wars TCG - FAQ</h2>
<h3 class="subheading"></h3>
<p align="right" class="byline"><i></i></p>
<div class="headln">1. General Information</div>
<p><b>Where do I start?</b><br> The best way to learn the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG is by using the play mat that comes with the two-player starter set. It starts by taking you right to the heart of the game-combat-then teaches you how to amass your own forces, and finally lets you begin exploring the most advanced elements of the game. Once you've played a few games with just the starter set, you're ready to add booster packs to your collection.</p>
<p><b>How do I win?</b><br> If you control two of the three arenas at the end of any turn, you win. You control an arena when you have units there and your opponent has none. The three arenas are Space, Ground, and Character.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to know how to play other TCGs in order play this game?</b><br> No, knowing how to play other TCGs is not required. It can be helpful, but does not give you a considerable advantage once you've learned how to play.</p>
<p><b>Can I play this game with other <i>Star Wars</i> card games?</b><br> No. The <i>Star Wars</i> TCG is a brand new game from Wizards of the Coast. Cards from other <i>Star Wars</i> games are not compatible with it.</p>
<p><b>Can I play with just boosters, or do I have to buy a starter set?</b><br> The starter set contains many useful items, some of which are exclusive to it. None of them are required to play, but they will prove helpful when first learning the game. Even once you've mastered game play, you'll still find the extensive glossary in the full-size advanced rulebook that comes in the starter set indispensable.</p>
<div class="headln">2. Setting and Environment</div>
<p><b>Why did Wizards choose to start with <i>Attack of the Clones</i> as the initial release?</b><br> We had the unique opportunity to release an all-new game at the same time as the latest installment in the <i>Star Wars</i> saga. Basing the first set on <i>Attack of the Clones</i> gives players the opportunity walk straight out the theaters and relive epic battles right away.</p>
<p><b>Will the game contain content from other Episodes?</b><br> Yes. The <i>Star Wars</i> Trading Card game will cover the entire <i>Star Wars</i> universe, which includes both the films and the expanded universe. The Sith Rising expansion set, coming in July 2002, features even more images from Episodes I and II. Two of the stars of that set will be Darth Maul and Mace Windu. This fall, we'll be releasing the <i>A New Hope</i> expansion set, featuring almost 200 cards based on the movie that launched this epic saga.</p>
<p><b>Are you going to use the <i>Star Wars</i> Expanded Universe?</b><br> Yes. Wizards of the Coast has rights to create game cards based on characters, vehicles, and events from the full range of Expanded Universe sources in addition to all six feature films. Whenever Expanded Universe cards do appear in the game, they will look as if they had come from a movie.</p>
<p><b>Can I play characters from the light and dark side together?</b><br> No. Under the standard rules, decks can only contain light side cards or dark side cards, not both. There are also a wide variety of neutral cards that can be used in any deck.</p>
<p><b>Why are there different versions of the same character, and can you only have one version of a character in play at any time?</b><br> The heroes and villains of <i>Star Wars</i> are multifaceted, and their TCG cards are too. Each version represents a different aspect of the character. Depending on what kind of deck you're using and what your opponent's deck does, having more than one version of certain cards gives you a lot of flexibility. You only use one version at a time, but each player can have up to four different versions of a card in play at once. All the cards go in one pile (or stack), with the one on top considered in play. Called "stacking," the more versions of a card you have in a stack, the more powerful the character becomes.</p>
<p><b>Can I play Chancellor Palpatine against Darth Sidious?</b><br> Palpatine and Sidious are considered to be two distinct characters cards. You can, therefore, have Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Darth Sidious in play without worrying about who can battle with them each turn.</p>
<p><b>Do characters use the Force during the game?</b><br> Yes. Many characters have Force abilities built into their cards, such as avoiding damage and increasing power. Battle cards also allow all units-Character, Ground, and Space-to use the Force for all sorts of special abilities.</p>
<div class="headln">3. Abilities, Mechanics, and Game Concepts</div>
<p><b>Does each character have unique abilities?</b><br> Many Characters, as well as Ground and Space units, have unique abilities. Every single unit does not have its own unique ability-some have no special abilities, while others have the same ability as another unit. There are plenty of unique abilities to keep the game interesting, but not so many that every unit you play modifies the game and makes it difficult to keep track of what's going on.</p>
<p><b>Will there be enhancements or "power ups" for cards?</b><br> There are several ways a card can get bonuses. Some cards have special abilities that can be activated-often by spending Force-to make that unit more powerful. Others generate effects that always enhance units while they're in play. Battle and mission cards can also be used to temporarily boost a unit's speed and power, or to give it special abilities.</p>
<p><b>How can I tell the difference between card versions?</b><br> Cards that have multiple versions may all have the same name, but they each count as different cards for most purposes of deck building and game play. The easiest way to tell different versions of the same unit from each other is the version letter. This letter is inset into the border of a card's text box, just above the rarity icon and collector card number on the lower right-hand corner of the card's face. If there's no letter there then there's only one version of that card. Cards without version letters represent a typical unit, not a specific one. This is true even if the unit has a name that may seem unique, such as Clone Warrior 4/163. Since this card doesn't have a version letter, it doesn't represent a unique clone trooper and you can have up to four of them in play at once.</p>
<p><b>How do you "pay" for cards? Are there cards that provide resources?</b><br> The <i>Star Wars</i> TCG uses a system in which you get build points each turn. A single die roll determines how many build points both players get each turn, and your build point total can be modified a few different ways. You use these build points to play Character, Ground, Space, and Mission cards. Any build points not used are lost at the end of the turn. You also get 4 Force points every turn, which you can save up from turn to turn. Force points are often required to play Battle cards, but can be used to activate many abilities too.</p>
<p><b>Will future sets introduce new abilities and game mechanics?</b><br> Yes. In addition to adding new units, Battle, and Mission cards based on other episodes and Expanded Universe sources, each new expansion will introduce new card abilities and game mechanics.</p>
<p><b>Can I make a neutral deck, or do I have to be light or dark?</b><br> It is possible to build and play a deck made entirely of neutral cards. When playing the game, however, you still must represent one side of the Force. Which side you represent determines who builds and retreats first, and which player wins all ties.</p>
<div class="headln">4. Combat </div>
<p><b>Can I fight light side vs. light side?</b><br> The standard rules do not make provisions for pitting a light side deck versus another light side deck, but it is possible to play that way (as well as dark side versus dark side). At the beginning of the game, randomly determine who will play as the light side player and who will play as the dark side player. For the rest of the game, the player who's playing as the dark side builds and retreats firsts, and wins all ties. Similarly, any cards that specifically mention the light or dark side player affect players based on which side they're playing as, not which kind of deck they're using.</p>
<p><b>Can all cards attack or are there some cards that can't attack?</b><br> All of the units-Character, Ground, and Space cards-can attack as long as they're in an arena. Of course, Battle and Mission cards can't attack, though some may create effects that are similar to attacking.</p>
<p><b>How many dice does the game require?</b><br> There's no real minimum number of dice required to play. If you have fewer than 6 dice, you may find it takes longer to play the game, since many units will need to roll the same die more than once for a single attack. You can never have too many dice, but if you have at least 12, you'll hardly ever need to roll the same die twice for one attack.</p>
<p><b>Do certain cards have special attacks?</b><br> Yes. Some units have an ability called "Critical Hit" followed by a number. This ability does that amount of extra damage if at least one of the dice rolled for any attack it makes is a 6. Future sets will introduce more special abilities that affect the way units attack and do damage.</p>
<p><b>Can starships attack things on the ground?</b><br> Space units cannot attack Ground units directly. Some Space units, however, have the special ability "Bombard" followed by a number. This ability allows the Space unit to attack a Ground unit instead of another Space unit using that number as its power for that attack.</p>
<p><b>Can vehicles fire at starships?</b><br> Ground units cannot attack Space units directly. Some Ground units, however, have the special ability "Ion Cannon" followed by a number. This ability allows the Ground unit to attack a Space unit instead of another Ground unit using that number as its power for that attack.</p>
<div class="headln">5. Factions </div>
<p><b>Can I play neutral characters like bounty hunters in Light and Dark decks?</b><br> Yes. Neutral characters can be played in either light side or dark side decks, despite whether they have "good" or "evil" leanings. If both players put the same unique unit in play, they must bid for control of the unit each turn.</p>
<p><b>Are there neutral Characters, Starships, and Vehicles?</b><br> Yes. There are neutral Character, Ground, and Space units, as well as neutral Battle and Mission cards.</p>
<p><b>Can I mix light side and dark side cards into a single faction?</b><br> No. Under the standard rules, decks can only contain light side cards or dark side cards, not both. There are also a wide variety of neutral cards that can be used in any deck.</p>
<div class="headln">6. Vehicles, Ships, and Equipment</div>
<p><b>Will there be unique ships and vehicles like the Millennium Falcon?</b><br> Yes. In the <i>Attack of the Clones</i> set, there are several unique Ground and Space units including Slave I and Obi-Wan's Starfighter.</p>
<p><b>Do vehicles/ships have "shields" or "defenses"?</b><br> Some units have an ability called "Shields" followed by a number. This ability reduces the power of an enemy unit attacking the shielded unit by that number. Although this ability is called "Shields" it also represents thick armor and maneuverability as well as energy shields.</p>
<div class="headln">7. Development Process </div>
<p><b>Who designed the Game?</b><br> Richard Garfield, who pioneered TCGs with the creation of Magic: the Gathering in 1993, provided the initial design for the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG. Aiding in the design were David Eckelberry, Mark Rosewater, and Robert Gutschera.</p>
<p><b>Will you release more card sets as "expansions" like other TCGs?</b><br> Yes. Coming in July is the Sith Rising expansion set. It will delve deeper into the characters and events of Episode II as well as feature important cards based on Episode I. Then, in November is the A New Hope expansion set. It will be the first of several expansion sets based on the "classic" trilogy, with at least one set dedicated to each movie.</p>
<div class="headln">8. Community </div>
<p><b>Do the members of the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG team read the message boards?</b><br> Occasionally, yes. Team members that serve in all different capacities-from business management to PR, and even R&amp;D-will read message boards more often than they'll post replies. You can be certain that a hot topic will not escape someone's notice.</p>
<p><b>Will there be tournaments for the game? </b><br> Yes. Click on our <a href="/default.asp?x=swtcg/article/jedinights">Jedi Nights</a> program for more details.</p>
<p><b>How can I find other players to play against?</b><br> There are many resources at your disposal for finding other <i>Star Wars</i> TCG players in your area. Wizards of the Coast provides community message boards at www.wizards.com/community, as well as fan sites such as theforce.net, decktech.net, and thisisgood.com/starwars.</p>
<p><b>Are rare cards more powerful than common ones?</b><br> Some are; some aren't. There are powerful common cards that you will want to use in your deck, and there are powerful rares you will want to use. There are also rares that aren't especially powerful, but were interesting to have as part of the game for reasons of flavor, theme decks, or other factors.</p>
<p><b>Why do some cards have more power and cost less than others?</b><br> When you're designing a card game, you have to accept one thing as true. Not every card is going to be exactly the same power level as every other card. First of all, because that's not really possible if you're going to develop a large number of cards. Second, you wouldn't really want every card in a card game to be identical on a power curve. Games that make every feature and every choice equally strong aren't good games, since they don't allow players to make good choices (or bad choices).</p>
<p><b>Can I play this game with more than two people and if so how does combat work?</b><br> The game is designed around a 1v1 game, but yes, we've played some variants involving four players (two Light side players and two Dark side players). The game plays the same, for the most part, as each opponent can only attack the unit's of one of his two enemies. However, you can =help your partner at times with various unit abilites, combat cards, and mission cards. Whenever one player of a team is defeated, both players on the opposing team can attack that player's units directly.</p>
<p><b>Why does this game use dice for combat?</b><br> Because dice are interesting. Dice are fun. They also capture the feel of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, where literally anything can happen. With a little luck (and perhaps a little Force), a hero in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe can change the fate of the galaxy. Witness the history of a certain dirt farmer from the most distant and dismal corner of the galaxy, or the heroism of a certain selfish mercenary trader. The <i>Star Wars</i> universe is open to possibilities, and so is the <i>Star Wars</i> TCG.</p>
<p>Not only to do dice introduce an obvious element of randomness, they also allow more design space for cards that can affect die rolls (positively or negatively), key results to specific die rolls, and allow die rerolls. They also allow players another opportunity to play optimally or suboptimally by predicting most likely results and planning for the best, while being prepared for higher than average or lower than average die rolls. </p>
<p><b>Can cards retreat from combat or can you send reinforcements?</b><br> Yes to both. </p>
<p><b>Are there cards that can fight in more than one arena?</b><br> There are combat and mission cards that can affect more than one arena, but there are no units that can be deployed to more than one arena. Yet.</p>
<p><b>Are creatures like Dewbacks considered ground vehicles?</b><br> Some are. It depends on their physical size and how they appear in the film. Dewbacks probably will be ground units, yes.</p>
<p><b>Will there be a Death Star ship card?</b><br> Yes. Fear its arrival.</p>
<p><b>What does "R&amp;D" do?</b><br> Research &amp; Development is responsible for creating card concepts, developing the cards and expansion sets, playtesting them, and working with the Lucasfilm to create a game that can best represent the great themes and elements of <i>Star Wars</i>.</p>
