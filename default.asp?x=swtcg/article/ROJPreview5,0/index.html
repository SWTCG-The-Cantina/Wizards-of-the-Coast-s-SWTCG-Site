<p>By now, you've had a taste of what <i>Return of the Jedi</i> has to offer the Dark Side and the Light Side. But what about the fence-sitters, those who refuse to choose sides, the &#8220;Switzerland&#8221; of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe? Here&#8217;s a peek into what <i>Return of the Jedi</i> has in store for the Neutrals.</p>
<p>For those of you who play <b>Magic: the Gathering</b>, you may be familiar with the classification of a TCG player as a &#8220;Timmy&#8221;, a &#8220;Johnny&#8221;, or a &#8220;Spike&#8221;. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with these terms, I encourage you to take a look at <a href="/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr11">Mark Rosewater&#8217;s article</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have an idea of the three rough categories that most players fall into, you&#8217;ll be able to appreciate that the Neutral units in <i>Return of the Jedi</i> have a little something to offer to the Timmy, Johnny, and Spike in all of us. Let&#8217;s get to the cards!</p>

<p>Why not start out with a bang? The Rancor should have the Timmy in everyone jumping up and down. What&#8217;s better than absolutely bashing the guts out of your opponent&#8217;s Ground units, safe in the knowledge that they&#8217;re not going to prevent a point of it? Granted he carries a hefty price tag, but the certainty of his damage sticking is not to be underestimated. <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Anakin@s[Podracer[(A)')" cardset="" align="">Anakin's Podracer (A)</a> giving you fits? <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Wedge[Antilles[(B)')" cardset="" align="">Wedge Antilles (B)</a> taking the sting out of your attacks? The Rancor won&#8217;t even notice.</p>
<p>The fact that the Rancor is both a Tatooine unit and a creature means he will receive bonuses from cards such as <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('RIC-920')" cardset="" align="">RIC-920</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Geonosian[Picadors')" cardset="" align="">Geonosian Picadors</a>, <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Wampa[Cave')" cardset="" align="">Wampa Cave</a>, and <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Tatooine[Desert')" cardset="" align="">Tatooine Desert</a>. And let&#8217;s not forget the recently spoiled Malakili (A)! A deck focused around creatures could use Malakili (A) to boost the Rancor to a 20/10/10 unit&#8212;able to use Intercept to soak up enough damage to allow your other Ground units to survive long enough to attack, and then deliver a nasty beat-down himself. I&#8217;m starting to understand why Jabba kept one of these things around!</p>
<p>Speaking of the Rancor, what of his most infamous meal (no, not the Gamorrean)?</p>

<p>Some people have been wondering if Lucky was a mechanic that would only be seen in <i>The Phantom Menace</i> set. Oola (A) puts those fears to rest. Lucky is here to stay. While not much of a powerhouse herself, Oola&#8217;s gift of Lucky 1 to each of your Characters could be quite valuable in a deck that swarms in the Character arena.</p>
