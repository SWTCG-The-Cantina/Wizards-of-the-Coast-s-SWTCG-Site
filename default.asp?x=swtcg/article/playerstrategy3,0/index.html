<td valign="top">In this week's Behind the Scenes, we talked to R&amp;D about one of our favorite cards from the <i>A New Hope</i> expansion.<p>Some have asked where the Krayt Dragon image came from and some have noticed that the image was was indeed somewhat based on a sketch done for <a target="_blank" href="
            /leaving.asp?url=http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/&amp;origin=swtcg_article_playerstrategy3"><i>Star Wars</i> Galaxies</a>, an upcoming MMORPG.</p>
<p>The card was designed early during the development of <i>A New Hope</i>. The designer (David Eckelberry) wanted something that could eat up small units like popcorn - something that he could see a fearsome Dragon doing, and it fit with the depictions of the Krayt that had been seen in <i>Star Wars</i> comic books.</p>
<p>During playtesting, the card saw moderate use, and in two separate instances R&amp;D increased its size (the first time, just for flavor, the second time to make him more likely to see constructed play.)</p>
<p>David recalled that during playtesting, the Krayt ran up against <a class="swtcgautocard" href="javascript:SWTCGautoCardWindow('Trade[Federation[Battleship[Core')" cardset="" align="">Trade Federation Battleship Core</a>s and got savaged yet other times he would munch through weenie swarms that hadn't manage to kill him before he could attack.</p>
<p>In all, R&amp;D was pretty happy about the balance.</p>
