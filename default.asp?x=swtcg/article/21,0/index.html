<p>Uncommon</p>
<p>Overkill is one of two new abilities debuting in the <i>Jedi Guardians</i> set, to be released on July 7th, 2003. If you play with large units, you're gonna love Overkill. Don't you hate it when you have to use a 7 Power unit to deal that 1 last point of damage to a seriously injured unit? Overkill lets you make that attack and not waste a single hit. The Overkill ability allows you to send hits in excess of the defending unit's remaining health to another unit in the same arena. Say you score 4 hits on those 7 dice. Apply 1 to finish off the hurtin' unit and 3 to another unit in the same arena. You might even take out 2 units with one attack!</p>
<p>However, if you think your opponent is holding, say, a Pilot's Dodge, you can apply 3 damage to the doomed unit and 1 to another unit, just to be sure. But since Tactical Leadership gives Overkill to all your units in the arena, there's really no harm in going for broke.</p>
