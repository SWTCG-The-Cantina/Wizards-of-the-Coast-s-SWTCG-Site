</div><img border="0" align="right" src="/global/images/swtcg_article_ROJPreview4_picMain_en.jpg"><p>Your opponent&#8217;s Space arena has a single, small Dark Side unit. You cast your eyes over their build zone. A few counters here and there&#8230; nothing menacing&#8230; and besides, it's far too late now anyway.</p>
<p>You smile to yourself as you deploy Luke&#8217;s X-wing, attacking and easily taking out that last small unit.</p>
<p>But wait, why is your opponent smiling? You control the Space arena, it&#8217;s all falling into place for you&#8230;</p>
<p>Their hands are moving&#8230; one to their Force total, one to a unit in the build zone. What&#8217;s happening?</p>
<p>You have just walked into a trap, my friend. That is what is happening.</p>
<p>The new Hidden Cost mechanic is really going to make a difference in the way we play this game. No longer are cards in the build zone things to worry about in the future; they now represent threats that can suddenly emerge and throw themselves into battle.</p>
<p>Take a look at this beast for example. Once this unit has at least 3 build counters on it, you can pay the rest of its cost with Force, deploying an 8 power, 8 health unit with Overkill during any "play or pass" chances (except damage prevention and Lucky/reroll POPs).</p>
<p>For more information on how the new Hidden Cost ability works, look for the <i>Return of the Jedi</i> FAQ, due out the release day of the expansion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this first sneak peek into the new set&#8212;an expansion I think you'll agree is going to seriously shake up the current environment.</p>
<p>Until next time&#8230;</p><br><p><i>Thoughts or comments? Visit the message board thread for this article <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=4602000#post4602000"> here</a>.</i></p>
